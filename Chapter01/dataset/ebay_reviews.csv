Headsets,Wireless gaming headset ,This gaming headset ticks all the boxes # looks grate # built to last #  excellent sound & mic # comfortable to wear # easy to set up what more could you ask for.,5
Headsets,"Good for those with a big head, low budget","Easy setup, rated for 6 hours battery but mine has lasted for sessions over 8, good loudness from the earcups, has a comfortable seal And thick padding around the ears for a person with a med to big head. Would look funny on a small child though as they are large headphones. Mike sounds ok for price.  Lighting effects work and look good.  Decent purchase would recommend for casual gamer needing the benefit of low cost audio solution. Not for the audiophile.Read full review...",3
Headsets,MezumiWireless Gaming Headset,"I originally bought this wireless headset for my Xbox (latest model) with the 3.5 plug jack in the headset. Unfortunately it didn't work, but nothing seems to work with the Xbox. So I connected them to my Dell laptop. They are just the best very crisp and clear, very easy to set-up. They are a very reasonable price for a high quality headset. I find that I can wear them for long extended periods. Also with them being so adjustable my wife,my  two boys plus myself can use them they are so versatile for the whole family to use.Very comfortable fit around my head with the padding on the ears soft and keeps outside noise out adding to my listening pleasure. Being wireless is such a bonus for me as not only can I move about the room freely if need but I can actually go into another room without any loss of reception. I'm no reviewer by any means but IMHO. this wireless headset is well worth recommending to anyone that wants a decent headset with excellent audio for a very reasonable price. All I have left to say is go and get yourself a set you won't be disappointed and you will definitely not be ripped off by ending up with a dud headset. I don't mind admitting that I have to watch the way I spend money but this headset was money well spent. Anyhow I hope this helps you on your search and decision when you you and buy. That's up to you as I'm happy and that's what really counts to me when it comes down to itRead full review...",5
Headsets,HW- S2 great headset.,"This is my 2nd Mezumi headset, It kills the first one , better range , lasts longer before re-charge & more comfortable fit. I had to buy a longer charge lead  so I could plug it in while wearing . Not really needed for my length of use per day.Read full review...",5
Headsets,BEST HEADPHONES I'VE PURCHASED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE,"This is probably the best headset I've purchased till date. The sound quality is superb and so is the mic. SOund Booster works perfectly as I tuned the headphone's volume to full using the key on left ear bud and controlling the volume from my PC's volume controller.Please remember that BUILD QUALITY is Superb and would definetly recommend this to anyone. Cost is 55 bucks only but quality can be comparable with Seinheinsser's 1000$ Headphones and still I'd prefer this one.Battery Lasts longer than 8 hrs for sure, not sure why the manufacturer has mentioned only 6 hrs. Even the range is more than 10 meters.I love y'll for making this amazing product. The lights are actually so perfect as it matches my build and considering the fact that these headphones are wireless, I'd defintely recommend this if your Battle station is of Solid Red Color.Read full review...",5
Headsets,"Great Headset, worth the 50$!","This headsert is great for the value! I recently bought it and everything about this headset is great for the money. It's increadibly comfortable, although it fits larger heads better (would not recommend for younger children or people with small heads), and i could comfortably wear it for a couple of hours. There is no delay, both receiving and transmitting, and no audio skips. The sound quality is quite good, it covers highs and bass pretty well. You won't be getting amazing sound quality, as this is a 50$ headset, but nonetheless the sound quality is pretty good. Battery life was pretty long (about 6 hours) and lasted gaming sessions. It takes around 4H to fully charge from 0 to 100%. The controls on the side of the headset work well.Read full review...",5

Video Games,Best fighting game on the Switch so far!,"This is a great game for all switch owners. There is about 70 characters excluding DLC and you can customize and play as your own mii fighters as well as customize a stage to battle in. The story mode is like a chesspeice-style fighting game where you move around a board and select your battles. After being introduced to brawl and its story filled with awesome cutscenes, It's a bit of a bummer this game doesn't have much of a story and barely any cutscenes to go with it. There is also no couch co-op in the story mode (spirit mode) which is also a bummer, but because of the way they set of story mode along with its chess peice style gameplay, it makes sense. I personally prefer how they handled story mode in brawl but this game is great regardless. It's super fun and allows you to play characters spanning from even more different franchises like Ryu from Street Fighter or Megaman from the Megaman series :)Read full review...",5
Video Games,the best Smash Bros. game,"Incredible amount of content, very nostalgic and perfect gameplay. Even the online mode is a major step up from Smash on Wii U : lag is almost gone. This is the best Smash Bros game Nintendo has put out yet and deserves a spot in anyone's Switch library.Read full review...",5
Video Games,Arrived early with an included blank case,"Won't be able to test the game until I get my switch, but tried it in my brother's device and it recognized the card (he had a smash digital download already).

Video Games,It's Mario 64 all over again. And that's AWESOME!,"Remember how you felt playing Mario 64 or Ocarina for the first time? That sense of wonder, how each new area or action was a discovery?  This game does exactly that. It does borrow a little from Banjo Kazooie but that was a great game to so who cares!My only complaint is that they push using the joycons from time to time, but there's no reason you can't use the pro controller and still enjoy every part of this game.Read full review...",5

Video Games,The Last of Us Part II is a Masterpiece.,"There literally aren't enough stars to rate this game. Not exaggerating when I say it may be the best video game I've ever played. It is so well-written, deliberate, and finely-crafted that it does it a disservice to merely call it a ""game."" Its something more like playable literature. If it had been released as an 800 page novel, it would have almost certainly won the Pulitzer.Read full review...",5

Video Games,Great game ,"The game is well made and flawlessly produced. The gameplay is addictive , fun and varied . The story has some shortcomings but do not let that deter from an amazing cinematic gaming experience. This game truly is a beautiful and compelling send off to an amazing console . This pushes the ps4 to its limits and uses every bit of technology available to deliver an awe inspiring and emotional experience. The sheeple giving this a bad review are only doing it because other people are and haven‚Äôt even fully experienced the game. The story I‚Äôll admit is slightly flawed but everything else about this game is a masterpiece and the creators of this should be proud.Read full review...",5

Video Games,Fun game to play with friends,"Got this game not playing the first one first, didn't know exactly what to expect other than an online first-person shooter. Got on PS Plus with some of my friends and started learning the depth of the game. At first the leveling system and engram system we're a little difficult to understand, but after talking to friends I got the hang of it pretty quickly.Graphics are great, physics are pretty good. I always like games where you can see your legs in the game. I would like to see more character development, but coming from someone who hasn't even played the first Destiny, it's not a dealbreaker. The game is worth it, if only for the fun experiences you will have grinding with your friends.Read full review...",5
Video Games,Same like the 1st destiny,After hours of playing destiny to it doesn't seem like much of a difference from the first game is still tons of farming tons of playing and I don't see much of a difference to be honest I said if I level up to 20 I'm gonna sell the gameRead full review...,3
Video Games,Five stars shooting game,"Bungie did a superb job with the new Destiny 2. Graphically Destiny 2 is beautifully presented. Have a mixture of weapons in the game, from automatic rifles, sidearms, and shotguns to sniper rifles and machine gun. But the fun part of the game is when you use power weapons. The game is about looting and shooting but has much more between that. It is a satisfying experienceRead full review...",5
Video Games,Great game!,You can co-op online and also death match. I love that it has a story line for solo missions also. Mainly plays first person but offers the third person social aspect in certain areas of the game. Overall a good experience for it being my first Destiny game I‚Äôve ever played.Read full review...,5

Headphones,Amazing wireless headphones from Sony! I'd compare to highest end Bose all day!,"Excellent bluetooth range, plenty of volume, less bass heavy than Beats Studio 3, but very good sound quality much like Sony's MDR studio headphones. Very flat response, but very clever app for Apple and Android with eq feature and more. Noise canceling is A+, phone calls sound great on both ends... Highly recommend this product! Best bang for the buck for sure! I'd rate them 4.5 outta 5, the only con is not as bass heavy for the hip hop edm fans.Read full review...",5
Headphones,Awesome sound quality with decent noise cancellation and good comfort,Stunning sound quality -- crisped clarity with excellent details.  The bass is a bit heavy at default setting.  I used the app to tune it down one step.  Don't need to search for other headphones unless you want audiophile sound.  Noise cancellation is good enough for normal use. Ambient mode is decent that I can hear the external sound. Read full review...,5
Headphones,"wh910n is okay, but wh900n is still better in sound","I would say wh900n is definitely better in overall sound quality and bass quality, and also, more comforfable where wearing longer, compared to the wh910n. wh900n has a longer distance between the hears and the sound unit, so a thicker cushion. wh910n has better bluetooth connection, bettery performance, and a lighter weight. But for the shape and the material, I like the style of wh900n, and the metal feeling of wh900n... wh910 feels more plastic.....Read full review...",4
Headphones,Great value headphones,"Great headphones for the price. My other pair is the Sony WH-1000XM3, and these are actually comparable with those (other than that these have a 25mm driver and the XMs, 40mm - which only means you need to have higher volume levels on the h.ear which in-turn means faster battery discharge).

Prepaid Gaming Cards,"Code was emailed, worked.","I've had a PS Plus membership for about 6 years.  Usually renew near the end of the year, since there are often sales 2 weeks before Black Friday.

Got a link to the code in my email within 30 minutes, typed it into my PS4 and it worked.Read full review...",5
Prepaid Gaming Cards,Amazing,With everything going on now days from scams on unemployment to renting fake houses I for one thought this was a scam.

Prepaid Gaming Cards,Very Good Deal,"Best price found. Digital code sent within 12 hours, redeemed and confirmed valid. Very easy and quick. From a personal view, there are other sites offering the same price at a ""higher % off"" but upon checking them out the state a higher base price above what Sony actually charges. That made them suspect. I used this based in reviews and pleased with the outcome along with the fact it was recommended by Gamespot.Read full review...",5
Prepaid Gaming Cards,Great Deal no problems worked just like any other code ,Super deal just type in code in ps store it adds deal to cart complete checkout and your good to go! 12 more months added to current subscription You do not lose anytime remaining on current subscription.

Way better then spending $60. I‚Äôll be buying another for my son as soon as his month is over Read full review...,5

Prepaid Gaming Cards,"Basically required, good values on ebay","I mean, it's a year of a spectacular online service and most sellers here sell it for less than Sony's MSRP. You really can't go wrong.All in all, it provides online play (which I still think you shouldn't have to pay for, but whatever) but Sony also gives out a couple of free games every month as long as you're a subscriber, so it's one of those things where the longer you subscribe, the more valuable it really it.The games have been a little hit or miss this past year, and the online service is iffy sometimes, and by no means does it approach the value prop of Microsoft's GamesPass ultimate... but it's basically required if you want to take full advantage of the PS4's functionality.Read full review...",5
Prepaid Gaming Cards,Awesome price!,"To anyone looking into reviews to see if its a scam, its not lol I also went through here anxiously reading along, my order did take almost 11 hrs unlike most customers, make sure you have your email thats established for ebay available because thats how I received my code, yes it does look too good to be true but this seller actually is great,  to those reading all the other generic reviews, hopefully this will calm you a bit down on you decision of buying or if your waiting on the item.Read full review...",5
Prepaid Gaming Cards,Great price for a PS 12 month membership,"This is a 12-month PS Plus membership, which was easy to redeem and at a good price.  Normally, they are $60 but were discounted to $30.  If you are looking to extend your membership or buy it new for the first time, try to get it at this price.  You get two free video games a month, and you have the ability to play Live with other players across the PS spectrum.Read full review...",5

Prepaid Gaming Cards,Good deal for Playstation owners,"I love the fact that every month PlayStation Plus offers two free games, for as long as you keep your membership. I may not play all of them, but have some games that I really enjoy. Last month, one of the games was MLB the Show 19. Not bad for a freebie!  Easy to download the code and easy to use.Read full review...",5
Prepaid Gaming Cards,great buy on sale,"I spend a lot of money on video games and paying to play online I have always hated; that's why I like pc a lot more. but there is something about console games that keeps me coming back to them. I would never pay $60 for a year to play online; per month that doesn't sound bad, but I look at that as a new video game I could have bought. I like the layout of xbox live, but that's because xbox 360 was my first online system so im use to it. playstation plus has a lot of perks such as free games every month and trials, along with double xp weekends on certain games. if you have a playstation and the internet, you need to have a playstaion plus membership.Read full review...",4
Prepaid Gaming Cards,Does what it's supposed to,"You need PlayStation Plus to go online and play multiplayer games. Without it, you can't do that. So it does what it's supposed to. Personally I think Microsoft and Sony are taking us to the cleaners by making us pay first for the boxes Xbox One and PlayStation 4 . And then make you pay for a subscription so you can play online.:/Read full review...",4
Prepaid Gaming Cards,Code works perfectly but having to pay for online access still blows,"Coming from the free PSN service on PS3 and openness of PC, I was honestly not happy about now having to pay for network access, and still aren't.  But these subscription models just seem to be the way the games industry is headed.  And I suppose Sony is trying to maintain parity with Xbox Live so if that extra bit of capital can help (and isn't just going straight into some executives pocket) them improve their network infrastructure and development I don't really mind that much about a nominal yearly fee.  And the free monthly games of PS+ is a nice gesture.  (Although you can only use them for as you have an active PS+ account)That said, this is the best price I've seen for the yearly subscription.  They send you the code within a day and you register it in the Playstation Store no problem.Read full review...",5
Prepaid Gaming Cards,Great Deal!!,"Was all little sceptical at first.  But since eBay usually will back up purchases I went for it.  Got the codr the next day thru email, sent to the ps+ site, added the card and got an extra year added on. Much cheaper than the 59.99 price offered at playstation.Read full review...",5

Prepaid Gaming Cards,For those unsure.,"This review is to help people understand the value of a PS+ membership.The product's price varies only a little as the retail version is $59.99 for a one year membership. That said, it's best to look at it another way. The price is only $5 a month. You get free games and huge discounts on sale items. The free games range in value, but you could get a $60 game for free with this subscription.The only drawback to the free games is that you only have access to them while you are subscribed.Read full review...",5
Prepaid Gaming Cards,Great deal! Really does work.,"Amazing deal!I can understand if someone was skeptical, but take this from someone who treats their game consoles like living breathing children, it works.Bought 2 for $60+ tax, and now I've got 2 years worth of PS+ for my upcoming PS5.Very satisfied, you get your code within under 24 hours (got mine in about 18)Read full review...",5

Prepaid Gaming Cards,Great for any PS gamer!,"It really pays for itself with all the games you got to download for ""free"".I'm not a hardcore gamer anymore, I used to buy the newest games always but now I only buy what I can play at that time, with the PS+ we usually get good games that are not so new included on the membership each month, so it's great to get those ""old"" games for free.Read full review...",5

Prepaid Gaming Cards,Quick shipping and saved some money,"PS+ is great! You get at least 2 free games every month for free (Make sure you log in to the PSN Store and ""buy"" the free games during the month so they're linked to your account forever. You won't be able to access them if you cancel your PS+, but they're still on your account so you get access back as soon as you become a member again). It also let's you play PS4 games with your friends online and includes a ton of online storage for automatically saving all of your save data online so you never use it. Getting this for $40 ($10 cheaper than retail) is just icing on the cake.Read full review...",5
Prepaid Gaming Cards,Works fine,"This seems like a weird product to review but yes, PlayStation plus for a year is good.

Prepaid Gaming Cards,Good stuff,Playstation Plus is great to have. The 2 free games a month really make it a worthwhile purchase. The added benefit of getting better discounts and the online help as well. Getting the year instead of the other iterations help pay for it as well.Read full review...,5
Prepaid Gaming Cards,Free Games every month. What's not to like!,"Comes with 2 Free PS4 games every month. Used to be able to get 2 PS3 and 2 Vita games but those platforms are slowly becoming end of life.

Prepaid Gaming Cards,Playstation Plus One Year Membership,"Easily a better option between the picks, a better way to save money as an option between spending (rounded up a penny) eighteen dollars every three months like I use to do for over a year, it was a no brainer to switch over to the one year card. And buying on eBay provided me with the extra discounts that I love which made it an even more enjoyable experience. No more worries of ""Am I going to be getting charged for my auto withdraw this week or next??"" or ""Does my Playstation live expire tomorrow or does it expire today??"" Now I just order one of these bad boys once a year (REPEAT: A YEEEAR) and I'm online shooting some crazy shit with my buddies daily (when I'm not at work or busy with family stuff) and I gotta admit and point out again, honestly, it's just really well worth it in my opinion.

Prepaid Gaming Cards,Legit,"They email you the 12 digit code to enter into the Sony PlayStation store. Alternatively, the email they send gives instructions on how to request the physical card be mailed to you.I am an existing PS+ member and still have 6 months left on my current membership. When you enter the code from this purchase or any other source, Sony credits your account to begin the day your existing membership expires.  So buying now at $40 is a $20 future savings.Read full review...",5
Prepaid Gaming Cards,Review,"Product was good and worked as should, but was the digital code emailed to me and still took the max amount of time to arrive. 5 days I waited for a digital code to be EMAILED... why?",4
Prepaid Gaming Cards,Worked!,Got the code within 20 minutes and it worked. I didn't want to pay full price since I mostly just want to go through my backlog of PS+ games and maybe play a couple with a friend. Doing it by one month or three months is a ripoff so my friend showed me this page. Very happy with it.Read full review...,5

Prepaid Gaming Cards,PlayStation Plus,I was skeptical at first because it‚Äôs not everyday that you find a great deal on plus like this.

Prepaid Gaming Cards,Good value.,"For a year's worth of high quality entertainment and the ability to enjoy that content with friends all around the world, I'd say $49.99 is a real bargain. Not only do you get the ability to play cooperative and competitive games with people all around the world you also get several high quality games for free every month just by being subscribed. You get a lot of other types of free entertainment like shows and events exclusive to Sony PlayStation. You also get regular discounts on many games and movies every month that you wouldn't get if you were not a PlayStation Plus subscriber.I've been an annual subscriber continuously since the introduction of the PlayStation Plus service and it's gotten better and better over the years. I've been very satisfied with the service. I'm sure that I've saved money well over the amount I pay for it every year just in the discount savings I accumulate throughout the year during the frequent sales on PlayStation Network. The subscription is worth every penny you spend on it and then some.Read full review...",5
Prepaid Gaming Cards,"Great price, great features","This subscription provides you with services such as Playstation Plus exclusive demos/betas/discounts, party chat, online multiplayer, and cloud saves.  There are a lot of flash sales for Playstation, so with the plus subscription it takes even more off of the price.  The party chat is not as good of quality as the Xbox One, but overall seems to be more consistent so long as you're running a hardwired connection.  The cloud saves are great for when you go over a friend's house and the multiplayer is great for wherever you are.  Overall it's a must buy for anyone who has multiple playstation consoles (with PS Plus games for PS4/PS3/Vita/PSP) and definitely worth considering even if you only have a device or two.Read full review...",5
Audio Docks & Mini Speakers,Great sounding speaker,"The sound is great, with full bass, it's easy to connect to, and the battery lasts a pretty long time (without the lights on). The lights are cool but that's not why I got it, so I usually keep them off to save battery life.The only issue is sometimes the volume suddenly drops low.  This is a refurbished unit, so it could be something to do with that.  It hasn't happened often, so I'm not sure yet if this going to be a continuing problem--mostly it's working great.Recently we were at an event where the electricity went out and the electricity (and music) went out--this thing was a great backup and filled a large room full of people with music until the power came back on.Read full review...",4

Lenses,Konica Minolta AF 50mm f/2.8 Macro Lens,"I think this lens would  be a ""must have"" for anyone who wants to do closeup photography.  It focuses quietly, rapidly and smoothly.  I bought it mainly to shoot plants and flowers.  Then, thinking I had more urgent uses, I used it at home and took it to the bank to take pictures of my jewelery--something I should have done years ago to create a record of important pieces for the insurance company, police, whomever.  I also tried it on coins, and stamps.  I could not ask for clearer brighter, better pictures.  Very impressive, indeed, without any computer enhancement.  Both circle lens light and regular flash worked well with it.  I used it on Minolta xi cameras.  I can only imagine what it will do on Sony Alpha 350, 700 and 900, even 100 or 200.  I am planning to find out soon.  I recommend this lens to everyone interested in closeup photographic work.Read full review...",5
Lenses,1984 (model 2562-600) A-Mount 50mm 1.4,Purchased in Mint condition. Plastic but sturdy build. Autofocus hunts in lowlight. Will plan to use in manual focus but serviceable in auto even though I would not recommend for a professional studio shoot. Nice hobby/pet project lens. Lightweight. Super sharp center mass at f1.4. Amazing colors and bokeh. Depth assist focus is a little unreliable with this lens. Continuous dmf is not an option at all. But if you‚Äôre like me and don‚Äôt care about that tech stuff this is an AMAZING lens especially for the price. Gives almost a film quality aesthetic. Definitely worth the purchase.Read full review...,5
Lenses,Execellant lens,"Completes the span of lenses I need for what I do. The 28mm, 50mm fast, 50mm Macro & the 100-200mm zoom fills out camera bag without emptying the bank account.

Digital Cameras,"Sharp images, great lens, useful features, all in one camera body!","I've been taking pictures since 1950 and have owned a photography business since 1981. Of all the cameras I have ever owned, I find this the most valuable camera that I have ever purchased.   The incredibly sharp lens combined with the very good 1 inch sensor and the 24-600 lens reach makes for a very useful camera.  The excellent auto focus is another plus.  The camera is complicated but can be customized for quick recall of favorite features.  Forget hauling 2 or 3 different focal length lenses with you, this camera has them all built into the body.  I bought extra batteries and a charger, but the usb charging is very handy.   There are lots of good reviews and tips and tricks on YouTube.  You can also tether this camera to your computer, a feature we used in our school and dance photography.  To sum it up,  wonderful camera !Read full review...",5

Video to my non educated eyes is as good as Panasonic GH3 (May be newer Panasonic with 5 axes stabilization makes better video).AF is simply great, Image stabilization is very good.

Digital Cameras,"Lightweight, versatile performer with excellent glass","I've owned this camera before and the found lens to be fast and produce excellent images. My interest is mainly landscape and portraits, and havingt wide zoom works well for most of my shots. A little longer reach would be nice, but then I'd be sacrificing speed and weight. After a long day of carrying a heavy camera, it is very draining.so I decided its really not worth it. This one is so light,its a pleasure to carry. My one complaint is the menus are not the easiest to navigate, especially if you're trying to get a shot quickly, it takes time to navigate through.

Video Game Consoles,Better than Xbox,"I have the Xbox Series X, RTX 3090, and PS5. The PS5 is, by far, the most bang for the buck as of 2020. Maybe next year Xbox will get ahead, but currently, PS5 is way better.",5

Video Game Consoles,Sh** price point,"I‚Äôm giving this a 1 star. Just for the sole purpose that this is being sold for 2k dollars which is 4 times the price. Please people if you about to spend 2k you are better off getting a gaming Pc which will last way longer than this console and have a beast of specs compared to the ps5 and series x.  If people are ok with throwing this amount of money away I will create a go fund me acct and I‚Äôll be more than happy to take your money, at least you know it will be in good use vs some as*hole laughing after he made 4 times the money. Just saying. Read full review...",1

Video Game Consoles,Late Christmas Present for Myself ,"After playing my sister's PS 4, I just knew that I had to have one myself. The price was great for the PS 4. Plus, I ordered 2 controller, 2 - 15' USB cables, a PS 4 & 2 controller Charging cooling system stand, and a great headset. Also, I ordered a MADDEN 17  PS 4 game and a couple other's.

Digital Cameras,"Excellent, solid camera, but has an issue ...","I bought this to shoot video.  It is the cheapest full frame camera you can buy, and besides that, I got a great deal on a used one that showed no signs of use.  I've never had a Sony before, only Canons.  It took me a little while to warm up to it, but like it now.  I got a couple of adapters to use my vintage Canon and Nikon lenses, so I've really gotten a lot of mileage out of this purchase.  I have the A7, but the A7s is better for video because of several features, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars for features.Beware of the Alpha models because of it's difficulty with blue LED lights - they create havoc with these cameras.  You'll have to research that topic to learn more, but you should not get one of these if you plan on shooting stage performances or even weddings.  That's the reason I didn't give it 5 stars for picture quality.It's as solid as a rock and feels great in my hands.  I dropped it taking it off of a tripod from about 5 feet onto asphalt.  The lens took the brunt of the fall and I had to search hard to find a small scratch on the camera, but the great thing is that it didn't phase it one bit.  Even my vintage Nikon 50mm lens is still working ...the beauty of metal construction.I see this as a workhorse type of camera that gives great quality shots.  If it weren't for that LED issue it would perfect.Read full review...",4
Digital Cameras,My new way to do things the old way,"This camera was bought for a purpose, i.e. to use with my legacy fleet of Nikon Nikkor manual lenses. Provided that, no internal stabilization is an advantage rather than hindrance, and the outline feature in the viewfinder and on screen does the job of capturing focus perfectly. With this camera, I can keep my old-school photography habits in the new digital format.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Awesome camera!,"I am a semi beginner and sticking to native lenses and using a high end SD card is key. I got a great deal buying a used set up. It initially came with a non native manual lens and a low end SD card. You cannot shoot in the highest video setting with out a 64G/95mbps or higher SD card. After upgrading the quality of the images is night and day!It does burn through batteries, so get extra ones. I got a battery grip as well, so I don't have to change batteries as often. But over all a well built pro camera.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Great Camera,"I absolutely love this camera. I have reignited my love of photography with this camera, and previously the NEX6. I got my old Contax Zeiss lenses out of the closet, dusted them off, and with a little adaptor, put them to use. The manual operation did not put me off, in fact it got me more involved in the making of a picture, and now I don't even like the autofocus gear any more. The Sony A7ii is superbly made, and it truly is one of my best purchases ever. Like everyone says, just buy a few extra batteries, because they empty out quickly, and enjoy this great camera.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Great camera;IBIS is just amazing,"This is simply a great mirrorless camera, with an amazing image quality and dynamic range. Image stabilization works perfectly and, combined with a good high-iso performance, helps a lot when shooting in low light scenarios. I haven't explored all of it's capabilities, but so far so good.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Classic and Vintage Lenses on the Sony Alpha A7II,"I bought this camera specifically (and exclusively) for adapting my classic and vintage lenses to it. Why? Five reasons: It's full-frame, you can adapt almost any lens mount to Sony's e-mount, focus peaking, EVF magnification, IBIS (SteadyShot.) Those five features alone are worth the cost of this camera.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,"All I need, and then some.","A great entry into Sony Full Frame Mirrorless. Battery life is on par with the reviews (not great, but fine for personal shooting - carry extra extra batteries if shooting pro). Autofocus is a tad slow, and hunts in low light - I think Sony has resolved this issue with the A7RII and A7III. But fully functional for my needs.Read full review...",4
Digital Cameras,A good little full frame camera @ a great little price!,"A very affordable full-frame camera that delivers good image quality and not so bad HD video. Sure it isn't 4K, the menu system can be a bit confusing however, for the price, a great deal for any photographer. I purchased this to have an extra full frame in my studio.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Favorite Camera,"I have tried a lot of cameras. This Sony a7 II is cost-wise and photo-quality wise a great camera.  After trying many of the cameras in the $500 to $1,500 range, I decided to keep the Sony a7II and Sony a6000.  Love both of those cameras.  Both of them take excellent photos.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,That¬¥s a great camera!,Image quality is outstanding!!! great EVF and film features. Canon lost an old costumer for this sony gear...buy a bunch of batteries and enjoy this small beast!,5
Digital Cameras,"Take those old SLR lenses out of the drawer, they are good for shooting with this!","Very pleased at how well this handles adapted manual focus lenses from just about all manufacturers, I've used Miranda and klunky old Contax rangefinder mount Russian lenses and it works great. The focus peaking with three different color choices is genius. Very happy.Read full review...",4
Digital Cameras,Worth it in 2020,"In 2020, the Sony A7RII is still a powerhouse of a camera. Sure, you have slower AF, burst, buffer clearing, and slightly different color science, but it still performs wonderfully. It has the ability to unlock 4k filming from 30minutes to unlimited.All in all, a great camera in a small package.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,"Old camera, still relevant in 2020","So far I love it with the 3 lenses I bought to go with it. Works well, takes beautiful images. It‚Äôs full frame + mirrorless. If you‚Äôre looking for these features on a budget, get it.",5
Digital Cameras,A terrific value! Sony is great!,"Great camera for the money! But as per usual for this model, it has the same low battery life. Use long life batteries.",5
Digital Cameras,icompetes very well with other semi-pro full frame DSLRs with extras!,"I upgraded from a canon 6D. No regrets - you can use quite a few canon lens now with native autofocus speed (only single shot available) which is a big plus.Image quality is excellent. Noise is very good at high ISOs. Don't believe naysayers, I owned the canon 6D ,the difference is not noticeable. The 7M2 focuses more accurately I believe.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,"Sweet camera, my first full frame mirrorless","The good: Lightweight, travel friendly, not intimidating like DSLRs, simply easy to carry around, slap on the Zeiss 35mm F2.8 and you've got it made!The bad: Just the battery life not being spectacular (I have several spares, of course).Final thoughts: It feels like I have lifted a weight off my shoulders!Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Great value for the dollar!,"For the price this camera cannot be beat.  Great value!  Exceptional camera for travel because of the size.  Use of crop Sony lenses is a plus as well, even with the pixel cut.  The only thing missing is in camera stabilization.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Sony A7 Mk II:  Great Value & Superior Results,"I am very pleased with my full frame Sony A7 Mk II.  The price was about $250 less than retail and the camera (a USA model) is in pristine condition.  I also have the Sony A6500 so I originally planned to use the A7 as my ""B"" camera, however, I was very impressed with the A7 stills and video results plus the battery life seemed better.  I do use a battery grip with the A7 so heat is not an issue--even after a 2.5 hour recording session. My Sony FE primes/zooms and Rokinon/Samyang manual lenses on the A7 produce superior results so the A7 is now my ""A"" camera.Only one disappointment with the A6500 & A7:  Only 1 SD card slot.  I await the A7 Mk III or A7R Mk III and will probably buy one if dual SDs (or dual XQDs/CFs) are available!  Otherwise, this wonderful ""mini DSLR A7 Mk II"" exceeds my expectations and coupled with the A6500, meets my demanding photo requirements.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,it is a cult camera!,"Sony made a miracle. When set with a Carl Zeiss Sonnar T 35mm/2.8, photos are super sharp from corner to corner.Autofocus is fast and accurate, manual focus is handy due to focus-peaking, photometer is trusty, contrast is high, colors are alive, low light performance is amazing, high-iso noise performance is of the best, body is made of metal and some high quality plastic, handling is stiff and ergonomic, viewfinder is of high resolution, design is just cult and lovely.If I could change something, is the low battery life - but it is justified in a full frame camera-, the ripping sound of shutter and the annoying handwristRead full review...",5
Digital Cameras,"Still a great entry level full frame, especially at this price.","Can‚Äôt beat it for the price if you‚Äôre looking to move into full frame. If you can afford it, I‚Äôd go ahead and move to the a7III as it features a more significant upgrade that, for me, is more worth it if you‚Äôre coming from something like the a6000.Read full review...",4
Digital Cameras,FF package that looks like soap box!  Street photo heaven.,"If street photography is your thing and you can score one at a good price, buy it! Slap ZEISS 35/2.8 on it and go shoot in any situation. Nobody will give you second look. You will blend right in with average Joe on the street sporting  FF setup that looks like average run-off-the-mill ""point'n'shoot"" while delivering world class snaps.The only downside is battery life. But those batteries are small, light and fairly cheap. So you can pack a few. I just removed battery door for most of the time so ""reload"" takes few seconds.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Love!,"Very sharp camera. Easy to use and light! I took it out on day one and was blown away by the overall performance. I'm still learning since I came from a Nikon. But so far, I'm in love. I debated for awhile about getting the Sony a7Rii and I'm very very very happy with the a7ii.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Best bang for the buck.,"Stabilization in camera, full frame, compact body, high ISO, audio monitoring for video, uses almost any lense in exsistanve with adapters... Not much competition for that. Great camera especially at the used price.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,"Awesome camera, and tremendous value.",This is probably one of the most inexpensive full frame options in the market and what a capable camera it is. I have the A7R3 and a couple of A72s as a backup and they are truly amazing tools!,5
Digital Cameras,Excellent Value Full Frame!,"A full frame camera for under $1000, with IBIS!  Can't go wrong!  Not the fastest for sports but great for anything else. With that in mind, and the ability to access thousands legacy glass lenses and Minolta A mount lenses, was the perfect choice for me.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Oversized point&shoot,"It feels more like an oversized point and shoot rather than a small DSLR. But the images are great. The size makes it great for travel. The plethora of adapters available means that just about any lens out there can be used, but especially nice that old Minolta Maxxum lens can be adapted to this camera.The menu system leaves something to be desired.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,"Affordable, compact, and powerful.","This camera has been perfect for me. It is pretty affordable for a full-frame camera, with very competitive image quality. For the type of shooting I do, I like a smaller camera, so it's nice to not have a gigantic camera to lug around. The image stabilization is not over-rated either. It's incredible. I'd recommend the a7ii for sure.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Love it!!!,It has very easy to use functions! Awesome image quality and feels nice in the hands. Does NOT feel cheap. Best purchase I ever made.,5
Digital Cameras,Great Camera,"I was a Nikon user for 30 years until someone loaned me a Sony Mirrorless. It's half the size and weight, and has many features that I never had on my other pro cameras at half the price. I especially like the FPS speed - almost as fast as Canon, and much faster than my Nikons.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Excellent Buy,"Great camera. Great price! Saved 30% off retail. Note to future buyers: the digital viewfinder is designed to kick in when you put your eye up to it, thereby shutting off the LCD while you're s using it in that fashion. Problem is, it's very sensitive, so it will blank out the LCD if you bring it down to waist level and cause too much shade to fall over the viewfinder. If you google ""alpha a7ii viewfinder sensitivity"" you'll find a DP Review forum article discussing an easy fix.Read full review...",5

Digital Cameras,Love this camera,I am in love with this camera. It is my first Sony so there is a learning curve as far as the ins and outs of the camera but it works perfectly. There are little signs of previous use. The eye cup was falling off and I couldn‚Äôt get it to stay but it cost only a couple dollars to replace that. No big deal.Read full review...,5

Digital Cameras,A WORKHORSE!,"I put this camera against several cameras close to it's price range and I'm it has surpassed them time and time again.

Digital Cameras,"Noisy shutter, low noise high ISO values.","I found the Sony a7 to have a very noisy shutter and missed not having a retractable flash unit. Even thiugh I used 6 different Carl Zeiss lenses on trying out the camera I never experienced the dramatic images I expeted from a full frame 24mp camera body. The most attractive aspects of the camera are its easy menu, its low weight (compared to a SLR) and the acceptable very high ISO values.Read full review...",3

Last shot I discovered while I'm shooting with Aperture priority, Manual Focus, when I half-press the shutter it adds just a little ISO.  I would get my model in frame, focus on her eye, half press while looking though the viewfinder until it looked perfect and snap.I had 60 or so perfect printable photos in no time at all.

Digital Cameras,Great product,This is a top of the line mirrorless camera. Its light weight and great picture quality makes it the best in class camera available in the market. Very fast operation with 10 fps and 4k quality shoots great. I have interfaced it with 64+128 gb in 2 slots. ISO boost is great too until a high value like 64k+ and images get sensitive after 12800 iso. Supports various presets and lot of quick menu options with 3 function buttons.Read full review...,5
Digital Cameras,Good,"This is the standard in mirrorless cameras right now. Canon and Nikon just can‚Äôt compete quite yet. The battery life is very good for a mirrorless system. The only current problem is that some Sandisk UHS1 SD cards do not work. Make sure to get a UHSII card if you buy this camera, or at least wait until Sony releases a fix for this issue.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,A7iii is Best,This camera is way better than the Z6 or Canon EOS R when it comes to autofocus.  Pics look the same when focus is nailed obviously but the Sony has way more and I mean way more keepers.  Learn the menu and this camera is easy to use.Read full review...,5
Digital Cameras,An Outstanding Mirrorless Camera !,"Excellent images....better than I expected !   And there are now several converters that allow use of your existing lens with the Sony a7III.

Most of the short comings of the previous versions have been corrected and improvements made.  The video results are very professional looking too.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Solid camera with amazing picture and video quality,"Amazing Camera with unreal picture and video quality.  Unfortunately there is still a 30 minute video taping maximum that hasn't been corrected, the camera simply stops taping a video at 30 minutes and Sony can fix that problem with a firmware update but has chosen not to fix that problem yet.Read full review...",5

Digital Cameras,View Finder makes it a deal,"Aside from the great Leica optics, the View Finder makes it easy to compose your photo.  I like downloading my photos to my camera at the end of the day using the WiFi feature.

Digital Cameras,Sony DSC-HX80: small pocket camera overcomes cellphone limitations,"There are advantages of Sony's pocket camera over a cellphone camera:Fits in any pocket (iPhone7 limitation). Not heavy or bulky, good for walking the city orcountryside.Takes 3 shots and averages them, removes motion and exposure errors. This featuresupports indoor wide angle and telephoto shots in low light such as the inside of a Cathedral.Setting for 90% of all photos: amber-colored ""i"", camera icon,""+"" on mode dial calledSUPERIOR AUTO.Viewfinder for harsh outdoor light and sports. Flip LCD for framing selfies and ground-levelshots like flowers, a mountain brook or a fish tank.Optical telephone and wide angle shots simply impossible with a cellphone.The inconvenient features include recording GPS data only by transferring the photos to acellphone that has the GPS catalog feature (i.e. iPhone). There is a installed APP availablefor the transfers, but too inconvenient for daily use. Android Near Field Connect untried.It may be convenient to do that at the end of the day, but not after every open-close of thecamera, as is done by the iPhone APP (one APP on the camera, one on the iPhone).The supplied USB cable worked to download photos from camera to Linux Mint 17.3(=Ubuntu 14.04) and Windows 8.1. No test of Windows 10 or Archlinux. The USB cablehas dual-duty as a charging cable or connector to an external power bank(i.e., AnkerDirect products). Liked the amber charging indicator.The learning curve required reading all the online Sony manuals for HX80. It took about oneweek to try out all the features. Good to have the possibility to solve a difficult shootingsituation, on the spot, by traversing the menu. The in-camera manual was invaluable a fewtime already, to decipher the menu itself.Read full review...",4
Digital Cameras,Packs a lot of punch,I purchased this for 3 reasons: 1) my point and shoot was dieing; 2) this has a pop-up viewfinder -- so frustrating when you can't see what you're shooting; and 3) powerful zoom. I may change to 5 stars once I use it more (there's way too much for me to use; as is with most hardware these days); not too keen on all the wi-fi they use nowadays with hacking but I'll only use a cable. But love the zoom feature for wildlife.Read full review...,4
Digital Cameras,FAST SHUTTER SPEED -- THE BEST SMALL CAMERA - POWERFUL,"As a professional photographer I went through many camera's before finally calling Cameta Camera and requesting a recommendation of a compact camera with a FAST Shutter Speed.  I take photos daily...and often many, many photos a day.  I work this little camera to death and it holds up better than ANY I have ever had.  I love all the options it offers.  It's POWERFUL with Clear, Crisp photos that take you into the deepest grooves of a finger print (macro) or zooms well across large areas to bring you close up (zoom).  The video is just as crisp and clear.  You can get all the details of this camera anywhere on the net but when a Camera Shop makes a recommendation, you know you are getting a quality product.  SONY has long been known for it's Quality and it hasn't disappointed me at any level.  I wish I hadn't wasted my money on all the other products I used before finding this camera.  RECOMMEND USE WITH SONY CARD READERS for the BEST RESULTS.  5 STARS Honestly Isn't Enough!  Spend a little more and get a LOT MORE RETURN of what you need, want and desire.  Amazing little camera.  I'll never be without one.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA FOR YOU!!!Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,great pictures --- but,"This camera is way more than a point and shoot, with manual controls plus many scene modes.  I need a compact camera and the 30X tele lens is amazing. My major concern is that I cannot see what I am shooting at on sunny days either with the screen or through the viewfinder.  Maybe there is a contrast feature that I have not discovered yet.Read full review...",4
Digital Cameras,See your subjects on a bright day with the handy pop-up view finder!,"I purchased this camera for my husband because he has had camera envy ever since he bought me the identical model last year.  He has an SLR and a point & shoot, but this one knocks his socks off!  With the pivoting LCD and the built in view finder, he can shoot in any kind of lighting.  It has many options built into this little camera that allows you to shoot so many different effects.  He doesn't have to fumble around setting up for a shot, then miss it because he couldn't work fast enough. I always carry it with me to get that perfect shot.  It's quick, it's easy and it's fun!  I would absolutely recommend this camera to anyone interested in getting professional looking photos, with little effort.  It's size is small enough to stash it away in a pocket or a purse.  This makes it perfect for traveling, or just going to the beach.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Excellent value with lots of features,"I was a little skeptical about the compact digital cameras in general. Because I have an i-phone which does everything reasonably well - photos & videos.

Digital Cameras,Good but not perfect,"This HX-90V is as good as HX--50V that I have in terms of Photo quality. Pro: it has a  flip up screen for selfie, very convenient. Con: you can not take still photo during video recording. This is a big drawback for this camera.Read full review...",4
Digital Cameras,Sony HX90V,"The Sony HX90V is a small sensor camera that will easily fit into a pocket. It has everything that could possibly be put on such a small camera. The EVF is very good as is the screen. Where the rubber meets the road in a camera, picture quality, I was surprised. At low ISO the quality is very good decreasing as expected at higher ISO. There is no RAW and I do not miss it. I have found that a little more dynamic range can be squeezed out of RAW in cameras that have RAW but not picture quality. I would say the HX90V is the best small sensor pocket camera made. Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Great camera with lots of features,"Love this camera. This is the second one I bought. The first one broke when it fell on a rock.  It has a ton of features. Yes, it's worth reading the user's manual. I love that is has manual options which expands the ability to get good photos in different conditions. The long lens is really amazing. For a camera that fits in a pocket you can get some great long distance shots. It's excellent for photographing animals that you can't get close to. No...it's not going to be the same picture quality of a DSLR with a long (expensive) lens but it's a whole lot better than a cell phone.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,SONY DID IT AGAIN!,Just like the other DCS-HX series cameras Sony has added some exceptional features and fell short on some on some of the basics. The flash has a manual pop up lever and does not work off the software like earlier models. Which means when the software is in auto flash you are required to manually open and close it. All in all it is an excellent camer for the money! The 30 times optical zoom is great!Read full review...,5
Digital Cameras,"Small, compact, great zoom","I haven't had an opportunity to use this camera to any great extent as yet, but am really excited about its small size. This will be a lot easier to take on vacation than my Sony a65 with zoom lens. I will also make use of the built in WIFI.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Great Little Camera,"I like to do low light and manual pics but got tired of carrying a lot of lenses and bulky equipment.  I found this camera by doing some research and I am very glad that I made the decision to buy.  It is awesome!  I really like the view finder and many of the options you'd get on a larger SLR. I can take total control of my pics or just let the camera do its thing. Zeiss makes excellent optics and the auto/program settings pic quality are very good. It took me a little while to get used to the little buttons and the main wheel but they are actually well placed and easy to get to.  Low light pics are great!  I do not use a flash unless it is necessary so I am always changing the ISO, Shutter speed and F-stop  settings with very good results. The fact that you can put it in your pocket and have the ability to take excellent photos is just great.  Anybody who does not like this little machine is surely not aware of all that it does.  My best buddy for any photos I need to take.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Sony DSC HX90V  Most desirable features and capabilities in its class,"Digital pop-up viewfinder, GPS; flip-up display with countdown selfie indicator : excellent low light pictures without the flash: great battery life, etc.  Its features easily bring the streets, markets and cathedrals of Europe to life for even the basic skilled photographer.  The islands, beaches, palm trees and sunsets of the Caribbean look fabulous on our digital picture frames in snow country.  Third generation Sony DSC that we have owned and it has every feature we could have asked for in the previous models, plus a fantastic new lens!Even recommended for the purists who find complaints with everything in life.  Even they will take pictures they truly admire, even though they would probably never admit to liking the camera that took them?Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Great camera,I had a model that was a little older and loved it until it broke on a vacation -- I learned these cameras cannot do water rafting and speed boating! My bad... so I had to replace and wanted to stay with Sony because of the great success with my older model. This one is even better. It is easy to operate - the flash is positioned better than the old one which was right under your thumb and the pictures are amazing and sharp. This is a lightweight camera that is powerful and will do everything most of us want. I bought a nice case for it so that it will keep dry! LOVE the cameraRead full review...,5
Digital Cameras,Little pocket camera with a big zoom,This is a wonderful take everywhere camera that has reach. It's not intimidating like the bridge style camers and I like it a lot.,5
Digital Cameras,Perfect travel camera,"Purchased this DSC-HX90V as a replacement for an identical unit lost on a recent European trip. I had that camera for 3 years, and used it on several long trips every year. Several characteristics make it my top choice.First, a 30x zoom; almost unbelievable in such a small package.Second, a flip-up screen. Thjis is probably used by most for selfies, but is my choice for overhead shots, or straight-up shots that preserve my neck muscles.Third, it is tiny. It fits in my pocket without even much of a bulge, and is allmost invisible in the palm of my hand.Fourth, very good low light sensitivity; some evening shots look like mid-afternoon.Fifth, a pop-up viewfinder. Bright ambient light makes every LCD screen I've ever seen on a camera unreadable and almost unusable. The viewfinder solves that problem.This camera has lots of bells and whistles, of which I only ring or blow on a few. And, none of that makes any difference without good picture quality... which is as good as I need (I'm not a professional, and I don't do huge prints).Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Perfect travel camera,"Great little camera   for teavel when your space is limited.  It's small, compact, light and very easy to use.  The zoom is amazing 24mm to 720mm is hard to beat - although the image does pixelate after the optical zoom range ends.The software package is alao amazing.  All in all a great canera and a great value.I did buy the leather case for it as it's not a camera that will survive even one drop.Read full review...",5

Digital Cameras,Love this camera!,"I loved the bigger version of this camera, the RX-100 series. This is virtually identical with the excellent photo quality due to the larger CMOS chip and excellent software in the camera. Love the tilt screen.

Digital Cameras,"great innovation, smart product and excellent value for the money","compact innovative, what a smart design.  great low light performance and excellent extension to a smartphone or any tablet.  Sony has truly rethought innovation.  Most of their products are well thought through, and differentiated from their boring competition.  After a decade, I'm finally buying Sony and looking for Sony first, again.  The performance of the lens and camera is definitely better than built-in phone cameras.  It is noticeable. It also adds zoom capabilities, greatly extending its usefulness.  the only thing that would have been nice is to integrate a flash, and provide better software/application capabilities, as to include smart intelligent shooting modes, and panorama.  Sony is however limiting themselves in this product by only providing basic functionality to a capable camera.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,It is some what difficult for novice to down load apps & make the cyber shot to operate.,It is very difficult for novice to complete the whole process easily to finally operate it. Sony has so many adds inserted into Apps in order to down load. Good luck....Note instruction on Utube are horribly demonstrated by geeks ....they have to come down to the level of a novice to explain it in very simple language . ThanksRead full review...,3
Digital Cameras,ok for some but maybe not for everybody,"Fairly expensive but kind of cool technology. Attaches easily to iPhone so you can see what you are taking photos of. when you take a shot, it delays as it processes the photo to your phone. I like a lot of the features such as the ide angle and telephoto settings but one thing that can be frustrating is when you lose the wifi connection and have to type in the exceptionally long password to rehook. This is not for everybody but is ok in my opinion. Definitely better quality photos than your phone can take.Read full review...",3
Digital Cameras,Exactly what I needed and wanted!,I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. Takes good quality professional pictures. Easy to use and hook up.

Digital Cameras,"Fun device, great value!","In comparison to the stronger Qx110, the Qx10 is a great way to start out and decide if it is right for you. The wireless transfer does have distance limitations and requires some attention. You can expect that Sony has a quality product with quality results. The pictures are far better than the smart phone camera and easier to position.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,"Excellent Value, Interesting Applications","While this product has been replaced by more capable Sony models, this model has a lot of life remaining.

Digital Cameras,Very powerful little guy !,I was looking for a lightweight yet powerfull add-on for my phone to take real pictures.This little device from Sony answered my requirements.I can take a picture with the lens from my phone very easily.

Video Game Consoles,"Good System, a decent game selection","My cousins have been bothering me about getting one.I own and mostly play on an xbox 360. (and i love it, sorry ps3, so my review might be a bit biased, i'm not afraid to admit it.) (also i do own a wii, its a paperweight most of the time)Personaly ps3 never had any exclusive titles that interested me so its taken me til now to get one.I do like that it has free online gaming vs the xbox. I still need to see if xbox vs ps3 servers are different in anyways.I guess i'll list off pros and cons if i can think of any.Pro'sobviously online gaming is free (wii has this too but wii online sucks)BLU-RAY PLAYER, heck yes. I have a pc with one but i've alway wanted one to have for my tv, now i have game system and a blu-rayClear graphics (actually for some reason when i see a ps3 game vs the looks of the same title on the xbox, its always looke clearer, or more clean)maybe a few select exclusives (can't wait to see what bungie has in store though) and also whenever kingdom hearts 3 comes out i'm now preparedNeither con nor pro (has features other have)Most have the same game selection (if you want good exclusives you can't really go wrong with nintendo, and xbox has the exclusives i like)Internet browser (cool yeah, but wii also has that, and so does everything else now, just xbox is a bit slow on it, e3)To me the controller feels weird and light (but xbox user here so not a surprise)Con'snow this is con for every system, accesories are always so freaking expensive.usb charge cord, too short, i can't play like that easily.... (now this one i don't own but still i want to right something on it) the ps move. WTF. Just an improved wiimote that looks weird. ... clown festival. (ok i'll say this too, kinect copied the ps2 eye toy thing, so borrowed ideas)So all in all a great system with a few borrowed ideas and to me a better game selection then nintendo wii but not as good as xbox.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,Similiar to Xbox 360 with some differences....nice system though pricey.,"I have owned about every game system that has been made.  In my opinion, this system is very similiar to that of the Xbox 360 Elite with the following exceptions:  Built in WiFi which is awesome to have, FREE PS3 online which means no extra fees if you subscribe to Netflix or play a lot of online games, and it has Blu-Ray.  The graphics, I feel are equal to that of the 360.  The only downsides I have found for this pricey system are that the games and accessories seem to cost more and there is less of a selection of game titles.  Also, the hard drives are not swappable like the Xbox so you can not take your games with you if you go to a friends house.  The biggest downfall is this particular system does NOT play the PS2 games.  All in all, I actually only use this system to watch Netflix and Blu-Ray on and to play a few of the move games.  I prefer gaming on the 360.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,"Great unit, very flexable & meshed easily with existing gear.","The primary reason for purchase was for the Blueray 3D capability.  Not a gaming person & haven't tried yet on this console.  Great for viewing pics on Flashdrives & DVDs.  Had no difficulty in setup, without instructions & a little ""fiddling"" with the controller I was able to operate unit ""like a pro"" in probably less time than it would have taken to read the instructions.  Pretty straight forward.  Will add the 'remote control' for less awkward DVD & Flashdrive operation.  Only real complaint, unit was advertised as ""New"" when in fact it was 'out-of-box' & used but obviously only slightly.  Otherwise the whole purchase experience was satisfactory & I would do it again.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,PS3 is all i need until the  ps5 arrives,Happy with the delivery and gb I'm able to put so many games i downloaded from the ps store but wondered why the user from before didn't erase or delete the user name before sending it to me.overall not many scratches and satisfied with controller thanksRead full review...,4
Video Game Consoles,Expensive but so worth it!! MUCH better than the 360,"I love the ps3 because you don't have to pay to be online and talking to your friends. While the Xbox 360 does do voice chat and overall communication between players very well, you have to pay $50 a year to do so. (That can add up!!!)It makes no noise,unlike the 360, it has a TON of memory space which is a MUST due to how much GB each game now takes, and it's a lot less bulky.The price is deep, but search around and you can find a good price, so it is def. worth the investment!Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,The Best Console of The 2000's,"The first PS3 i've owned was the original 40GB launch model. A few years later I upgraded to the 160GB Slim model... Now about a year later I upgraded to the 320GB Model and let me tell you I didn't think storage space would make much of a difference, but it did.PROS:- 320 GB hard drive, huge storage space.- 1080p HD graphics are awesome.- Free PlayStation Network membership.- Countless exclusive titles that will keep you entertained.- Very little to pay after buying the console (unlike the 360, you have to pay yearly to play online)- Blu-Ray / DVD player is installed so you can watch movies in HD- Blue-tooth controller is great, design and fits comfortably in your hands.- Worth every penny, even if you buy it new at a retailer.CONS:- PSN servers sometimes aren't the greatest (especially with older titles) but if you have a decent connection you should be fine.- Installing games sometimes takes up to 10 minutes (depending on the game's file size)Overall the best console to own right now. Can't wait for the PS4 to be announced in the next few years.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,"""Great system without any issues""","Only bad part about it has a slight scratched over my ps3 console, but this particular console was packaged very well and was a good price shipped very quickly,really quiet and function perfectly.",4
Video Game Consoles,Single. Married. Dating. This is the product for you!,The Sony PlayStation 3 is a wonderful device. This device is very useful and an enjoyment. As  this system can be used by both children and adults. On this console u can play both games and movies. This includes blue-ray disks. While children enjoy watching their favorite movies with blue-ray they can interact within the movies. Then following the movie they can play the game. The PlayStation console is something that your whole family will enjoy. It is also something that you can constantly use. Also with the PlayStation you can get Netflix which allows almost any movie to be viewed for $8 a month. You can also watch hulu plus. Both of these downloads provide viewing of television shows and/or movies. These are in many ways that the PlayStation 3 is useful. In my personal experience i have both Netflix and Hulu Plus. Both of these things make my PlayStation more useful. Also in my family my 5 year old cousin and my 41 year old uncle both can easily conrol and play multiple games. They also have one in there house. Which provides a graet amount of use to there families.Read full review...,5
Video Game Consoles,"Still really fun, better than PlayStation now",I got this for multiple reasons I wanted to play some older games that weren‚Äôt on PlayStation now I did look to see if they were available. So only other way was to buy a PlayStation 3  the work they  did on the refurbishing was great. Only thing is to get used to the old home screen.Read full review...,5
Video Game Consoles,It's the Best Console for an Awesome Price! I'm very happy :'D,"I have always wanted a PS3 since 2007. I think the PS3 is the best game console ever, cause you now that Wii is for kids and Xbox is good but to many problems i think. PROS:-Free Online Gaming (This was my number 1 priority)-Tons of Epic Games-320 gb is enough space i think-Wireless Controllers-Trophies System-Got a Blu-Ray DVD now.-Surf on the web-Making several profiles is very useful.-Bought it at $325, in my country is at $529. Make the calculations. CONSIt's difficult to see cons but i have some, even is they are kind of pathetic.-The controller USB cable is very short.-Doesn't bring the HDMI cable for TV.-I think 2 USB ports aren't enoughCOMPARISONS:PS3 and Xbox 360 are almost the same when we talk about games. PS have Epic Games that Xbox doesn't have and vice versa. At least i'm not worry my PS3 will burn and show me some red rings.... And if I compare the PS3 to the Wii i just think about start laughing.Also, I almost forgot, PS3 offers Free Online Gaming, Xbox doesn't and Wii...I'm not sure if it has Online Gaming...Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,BEST SYSTEM EVER!!!,"The PS3 Slim is amazing! Has a built in Blu-Ray and DVD player which means you don't need to buy a Blu-Ray player. Free Wi-Fi included in it. A wireless Dualshock 3 controller for use to play use and vibrartion function for most PS3 games. It runs less power so you don't have to worry about your game system overheating all the time. A great game selection and in my opinion best games/graphics than the 360. Comes with a free 30 day subscription to Playstation Plus which gives you free video game downloads for some games, free 60 minute trial demos for games where you can play the game for one hour and save your progress and buy it and you start from where you left off. Its like owning the game for one hour before you have to buy it to see if you like it! All in all, GREATEST VIDEO GAME SYSTEM TO DATE!!!Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,"High Def gaming, sleek design, good price, right on time!","I bought this product because I recently purchased a large LED/LCD HD tv. Not only was I looking for some gaming entertainment, but also wanted to utilize the quality of my picture and get some Blu-Ray action. Why buy a Blu-Ray player, and a video game console when I can have both in one?The ease of the machine is nice. Simple set-up, took 10-15 minutes, and it doesn't even seem long because you're customizing your machine, it's a computer. The game selection isn't as great as X-Box 360, but they are getting better, and I'm sure they will have as many cool titles. This doesn't take away from the good titles PS3 already has though. And while you can hook up the HDMI to the X-Box, the PS3 is built for that quality! One of the perks is the free online playing (nevermind the recent hack that took place, I purchased mine after that!)I own both, so my review won't give you the down and dirty as far as whether I prefer this or that, but I say this is a good purchase not only for gaming, but it looks good in your living room with its sleek design, and you can pop a HD movie in and watch on your nice tv ^_^Read full review...",5

Didnt know that before I bought it, so it will just be a slow process to be able to play with more than one person, as thats expensive! How can the wand be more than the games!The graphics and motion, are really cool.What made me decide to buy it was a love for playstation, and how theyve kept their paddles the same, also our ps2 died a few months ago so that meant time for a new one :)Read full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,Awesome gaming system.,"The good: Slimmer, more compact design with quieter operation; all games in high-definition; easy-to-use interface; doubles as a Blu-ray and upscaling DVD player; built-in Wi-Fi; 120GB hard drive; HDMI output with 1080p support; no external power supply; built-in Web browser; free online gaming service.The bad: Lacks backward support for PS2 games; no infrared port means non-Bluetooth universal remotes aren't compatible; online gaming, media, and commerce options still aren't as fully developed as Xbox Live, though they're getting better.The bottom line: With a smaller design, more energy-efficient operation, lower price tag, and built-in Blu-ray and multimedia capabilities, the PS3 Slim delivers a compelling package for an affordable price.Read full review...",5

Headphones,IF YOU WANT TO HEAR THIS IS A MUST!,"I have poor hearing and use hearing aids, I was missing a lot of great sounds in music and TV, so I bought the Sony 700DS.

Headphones,"Great sound, but if their is a problem, you can't get parts to fix it.","Great sound. Much clearer than my top of the line TV and home theater system.  This is my second purchase, although my first was bought used. It does tend to slip forward a bit, but the best sound of RF wireless system that I've tried.  One little tip though. BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY!  You cannot get repair parts in the U.S. and my repair tech could not fix the headphone charging problem that I had on my old one, because he said that it was too small.

Video Game Consoles,Last generation? Maybe. But it's still a great console! And you can play the games you love again!,"The PS3 has been out for several years, now, and has all but been eclipsed by the PS4's various models except for one thing. The PS4 is not backward compatible except for PSNow games which are streamed to the PS4. This is a pretty severe limitation to most PS3 veterans. If you don't already have a PS3, the best solution to this problem is to just buy a used one. There are a lot of good used PS3 models out there with the PS3 Slim being probably the best one of the lot. It's significantly smaller than the PS3 ""fat"" (original PS3) but has all the capabilities as its larger and older sibling.Many of these older machines have small hard drives (and I've seen a couple with no hard drive at all). These can be upgraded to fairly large (compared to the original 60gb hard drives) hard drives fairly cheaply. It's rather pointless to upgrade it to an SSD, though, because the drive interface is only SATA I. So the transfer rate is far below what would justify the additional cost of an SSD.Also, PS3 games on the used market are sometimes ridiculously cheap, especially on eBay.Having said that, it's better to buy a PS3 that has an original Sony PS3 controller bundled with it. The reason for that is cheap Chinese clone (counterfeit) PS3 controllers that are, quite simply, garbage. If you see a ""new"" Sony PS3 controller for cheap AVOID it. It's more than likely not a real Sony controller. That's not to say that the aftermarket name brand controllers are not any good, there are a lot of good 3rd party controllers out there. But the countefeiters build garbage controllers and use the Sony brand name while also not paying Sony any royalties on using their name or design. Caveat emptor with regard to controllers.I bought this a used 160gb PS3 on eBay recently after going a couple of years without a PS3. I even had a 1TB hard drive lying around from a laptop upgrade that fit perfectly in the PS3. I can put every game I own on that drive, now.  That upgrade isn't as easy as Sony likes to make it sound. But it's not too hard if you can follow instructions which are easily available on the Internet. Make sure you backup your drive (not just your save games/trophies, etc.) before upgrading the drive if you decide to do that. It will put all of your games, settings, trophies, etc. back just like it was before but on your shiny new upgraded drive.It's also nice that Sony still sells a ton of PS3 games on the Playstation Store. So, you'll find plenty of games to put on your new bargain.I loved my old PS3 and let it go when I bought a new PS4. But when I decided I wanted to replay some of my older games, I found that the PS4 would not play them. So, the only workable solution for me was to buy another PS3. No, the graphics aren't as good as on the PS4. But that doesn't matter if I can't play the games I want to play. And the PS3 Slim lets me play the older games I still want to play whether they're on PSNow or not.Read full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,"Is the PS Vita still worth buying today (Posted as of October 10th, 2018)","So, is the PS Vita worth the purchase, at the last months of it's life cycle?  It really depends on how you game. Provided that you have PSN games or PSVita game cards available in your area, you're likely to find a few gems around, and at good prices (in many cases).  For me, I have a variety of games, and some are imports.  I recommend buying (ASIA Region), as many of those games are with an English Option (some Japanese Region aren't in English).  What would make me apprehensive, is the PS Vita Memory Card format:  It's cost prohibitive, and is only likely to jump in costs.  While you can seek out a Henkaku ""jail broken/rooted"" PS Vita, the market price is almost double the usual cost of these devices.  Where as current market price for a used PS Vita presently goes for $120-$150 (and new devices going for around $190-240), the Henkaku PS Vitas (used) are going for about $200-280, depending on condition and version of hardware.Another thing to consider:  Unlike the Nintendo Switch?  The PS Vita only allows for one PSN account.  So far, I have not found a way to use multiple accounts on the same PS Vita, whereas I can store multiple accounts on my Nintendo Switch.  That's a bummer, as I now have THREE DIFFERENT PS VITAS for different purposes; one is a Wifi-3G ""Phat"" 1100 (which I use for Japanese region gaming), one is a PS-2000 (Piano Black - That's my Henkaku PS Vita...  Amazing with an SD2Vita card and 400GB MicroSD Card), and now this Electric Blue PS Vita, which can't (currently) be ""rooted"", so it shall be used for Asian Region games (again, because they also have games in English, that I can't normally  find in US Market).The game quality is somewhat like playing on a PS3.  Now, in this day, where the PS4 is reaching the latter end of it's lifecycle, you might think that is antiquated.  Well, remember that this is a portable reaching it's last months of lifecycle, and that the game quality for many titles, are excellent.  The portability of the PS Vita is much more convenient than the Nintendo Switch, and the some games, in my opinion, ported better to the PS Vita, than the Nintendo Switch, particularly with the JRPGs (which shine on the Vita).  The fighting games work well (I'm still playing Street Fighter x Tekken regularly, among others), and unlike 3DS games, the hours of play per title seem closest to console games.A feature that some might not know is that you can even link your PS Vita to the PS4, and game that way too! (Remote Play) allows you to play your PS4 on the PS Vita without wires, on most PS4 games (look for the 'remote play' feature on the game boxes and PSN listings).So, is the PS Vita worth the purchase, at the last months of it's life cycle?  Considering that you can remote play, and that there are many great titles available, I'd have to say YES, THIS IS STILL WORTH BUYING TODAY.  Of course, remember that the memory cards are overpriced, and that you should check listings for decent bargains before purchasing.  This is one of the rare instances, where the portable gaming system is starting to cost more, as the brand is nearing it's end of it's lifecycle, but when you consider the quality of the games, and are prepared to use the PS Vita for the style and method of gameplay, it's a hard bargain to walk away from; for classic and dedicated portable gamers alike.Oh, and one more thing...  The original 1000-series PS Vitas have brighter and bolder screens, but the tend to get some odd odd splotches and spots with time, when the screen is off.  It's not noticable while it's on, but it's worth noting.  The 2000s use a cheaper, LED screen, but the screen quality is still pretty good, and doesn't splotch.  They are ever so slightly dimmer, but again, you won't notice this while playing (unless you're used to playing on the PS Vita 1000-series handhelds).Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,Thank you,Who knew a buying a vita mid 2020 would be a great decision. The console I received looks pretty much brand new.

Headphones,wow!,"by far and away these have become my favorite cans. i have quite a few high-end headphones and i find myself reaching for these more often than any others. they are comfortable to wear for hours and hours but thet wouldn't matter if the sound wasn't great. they sounded great right out of the box but it has improved with every listen- accurate, tight base.  perfectly balanced mids and a treble that is clear, precise and not too harsh. in all , they sound as good or better than cans costing much, much more. sony has really upped their game with these headphones and i tell anyone who will listen- don't hesitate and get these cans and you will thank me later. they are worth every penny and then some!",5
Video Game Consoles,Classic but great fun for some old games!,I bought a PS2 so I could get in touch with my childhood and play Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2. I have no regrets! The system works as it should and starts up pretty quickly. I've been playing for hours with no problems. The system runs smoothly and effortlessly. I'm glad I could get a good quality used one to work so well.Read full review...,4
Video Game Consoles,Everything worked except the PS2. Had to improvise a fix.,"Everything came quickly in the mail and functioned properly aside from the most important part, the console. It came with a crucial part missing. Inside the console there are 2 switches, one at the front above the power button and one near the back to the left of the disc tray, that must be pressed for the console to attempt to read the game inside. The metal piece that fits in the top half of the shell to push the rear switch was missing which meant it wouldn't play games. Thankfully I was able to fix it myself, but most average people won't be able to which is why I'm giving this a negative review. You don't sell broken/incomplete products claiming they work, plain and simple.Read full review...",2
Video Game Consoles,We will see,My Ps 2 slim cane super fast! And I was super stoked I set it up and went to play. Sadly.... the ac power cord is only 5 v I have had to order the 8.5 v adapter elsewhere and wait longer to see if that fixes the issue of where it tries to turn on and immediately turns off. Hopefully that fixes the issue. The power cord it came with isn‚Äôt it‚Äôs original and is too low a voltage so fingers crossed this fixes the issue but I‚Äôm really sad because I was super excited to play my old games and also some I had ordered in anticipation. I bought this to replace my old stolen one :(So Sunday I will know if that was the issue or if there is a bigger problem. Hopefully not because that would be an absolute bummer.Read full review...,4
Video Game Consoles,It plays so well...,I absolutely love it. I bought it to primarily play Grand Theft Auto: Vice City a classic that my late cousin and I used to play day in and day out. Thank you for helping to bring back these memories.,5
Video Game Consoles,"Would recommend, may need to flip over to get games to play","Just got my PS2 today. Came in super early. Everything was wrapped nicely inside though exterior of box was a little concerningly damaged. Doesn't come with a memory card so you'll need to buy that separately. I couldnt get any of my games to read so I looked up how to fix it and it said to flip the slim ps2 system over and put the disc in (apparently that's a common problem with the slims). Its inconvenient but it got the games to play. So, for $100 to come with 2 controllers, arrive so quickly, and to give my twin and I the opportunity to play the games we grew up with, I'm happy and would recommend.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Travel back in time to 2005 and relive some good times,"Great for a little nostalgia or, as folks seem already to be calling it, a little ""retro"" gaming. Console plays like a charm. Naturally, this is an older and outdated console, so you should expect the graphics to be a little lower quality. For best results, play on a CRT and/or pick up SCART or component cables, rather than using the VGA hookup provided. VGA works fine, but will tend to look a little rough on a modern flat-screen television. PS2s were literally designed to be played on CRT televisions, so the graphics appear best on those; however, springing for a Component cable substantially improves the looks of things, even if you play on a modern flat-screen.Some of items in the bundle are probably going to be third-party replacements. If you're buying this for serious ""retro"" gaming, you may want to eventually find some Sony brand items; however, the console works fine enough when it arrives and you may not feel the need. I found the third-party controller included in my bundle to be functional enough, but I found the ""feeling"" of the button-presses and the light weight of it a little off-putting, so I bought some real Sony controllers to use instead. This is not to say what comes with the bundle won't work! Mine worked just fine! Just be realistic and remember you are buying a previously-enjoyed console whose original accessories may have long since vanished and have been replaced in a cost-effective way.The console comes to you clean and ready to go, including a PS2 memory card. The memory card included with my bundle still had a great deal of old save data on it, but that's easy to delete yourself... And to be honest, I didn't mind seeing DDR and FFX-2 game saves dated back to the mid-aughties on there, gave me a little chuckle.Really, a great bang for your buck. Totally recommend this little kit if you just want something to amuse yourself or play some old favorites on now and then!Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Worth it,This is a my favorite game console as a kid/teen and I'm so excited I got it... it has been used everyday almost since it was delivered to my door lol. The only downside is the green controller that came with it doesn't want to work anymore when plugged in the buttons when pressed don't work anymore. We press but nothing happens. Then also one of the grey controller the R1 button sticks... but other than that happy with my purchaseRead full review...,4

Thank you so much for the PS2, WIRELESS controllers and a free game !Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Playstation 2 used,I got what I wanted. I really enjoy certain games from PlayStation 1  games. The product and everything works well. It was in pretty good shape.,4
Video Game Consoles,Stylish and reliable (SCPH-75001),"I purchased one of these earlier this year (SCPH-75001), partly since they had become so cheap, plus I had received a gift card for Christmas for a game store, and since I haven't really been much of a ""gamer"" is recent times, I wasn't sure what to buy. The console has worked fine since I bought it - I've played it for hours and hours at a time, and the console just doesn't seem to give up. I think I've heard of overheating issues with these consoles, but my PS2 Slim seems to work just fine (and very quiet most of the time!). It doubles as a DVD player. It can produce stunning images with as high as 1080i resolution (I have witnessed this with Gran Turismo 4 and Tourist Trophy); one thing about images on the PS2 though is, especially when not in HD, the pictures tends to be much darker than what I experience with my XBOX, but simple solution of increasing brightness seems to be sufficient (not always great, but it works). Graphics, overall, seem to be decent on the small selection of games I've played, though I think I will say that, having access to all three consoles, that the Gamecube and the XBOX generally seem to boast higher graphics, though I would say that the PS2 has some unique graphics that can demonstrate that graphical power is ""not everything."" My PS2 Slim seems to have little issue running both PS2 and PS1 games (part of the reason I wanted a PS2 was to play older PS1 games). It's about the size of a small notebook when sitting alone (if you include the separate power supply brick, slightly bigger, but not by much, still pretty small). Overall, great, reliable little console. [NOTE - remember to unplug electronics when not in use if possible!]. God bless!Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Well packaged but some faulty parts,"The package was well maintained with new AC adapter and seemingly new controller, yet the Square and Triangle buttons are already unresponsive to sensitive pressing and barely work. The power button also gets jammed in the upright position which automatically shuts the system off after powering on. I don't want to shell out another 25 dollars for another controller, I expected this one to work fine.Read full review...",3

Video Game Consoles,Very satisfied!,I usually don‚Äôt write reviews because it‚Äôs somthing I feel like o should leave to the other consumers but this product for its price was completely worth the buy despite some cosmetic things like dust and a scuff on the top of the of the console it run very well and is definitely worth your money the cosmetics is to be expected see as it is a used system but what matters is that it works and I am very satisfied now I can play all my childhood favorites!Read full review...,4

Video Game Consoles,PS2 Super fun throwback!,"So with the upcoming release of Star Wars: Battlefront 3 on PS4 this fall, I started getting nostalgic for Battlefront 1 & 2. I still had the games but I sold my PS2 years ago. Luckily I was able to find a PS2 Slim on eBay. I am impressed with how small the system is. It runs great and the games play just as well as I remember. It's a pretty affordable way to relive the past and play great games you can't find anymore.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Wont read the disc,"Fresh out of the box I plug everything in and turn it on, great the power works so far so good. I put in the game I've been dying to play again since 2014 and it gives me a little trouble so i reset and it loads the game fine. Literally 12 hours later when i try to play the game the console refuses to read the disc it just read the night prior!! The disc is fine and I even tried a different game and it still wont read the disc.Read full review...",1
Video Game Consoles,Play Station 2 is a more then just a game console,"The PlayStation 2 is a console I shared with my sister when I was a kid, now I have my own. It's has a huge liberty of great games, such as Ratchet and Clank, along with Kingdom Hearts. The console can also play PS1 games like Crash Bandicoot and Mega Man 8, and all of the games play well with the controller. The coolest the part of the console is that it can also  be used as a DVD player, playing all your cool movies. This is a game console that any gamer should own and I personally think that any person will love owning the PlayStation 2Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,System works good,My purchase was a good one. The system works good. It reads both game and DVD discs. The condition is pretty good. The wires work and the controller work. My only complaint is the DC in Port is a little damaged so I have to keep the wire a certain way and be carful not to bump it or the system will shut down and I will have to rearrange the wire again. Otherwise I  say it was a good purchase and it arrived faster than expected.Read full review...,4

Video Game Consoles,Was not like in the description,"The controller did not work, neither did the video cable. Not sure how it was tested if there was no power cord and could only read certain memory cards so I had to buy a new one as well. I ended up having to buy almost all new everything and would have been worth my while to buy a different one. I also had to clean it as it was dusty and did not want to give it to someone in the condition it was in.Read full review...",2

Video Game Consoles,Great throwback game system,This throwback is exactly what I wanted to play a bunch of old games that had been sitting around for about 5 years.  With a component video cable the graphics and audio are exactly as I expected them to be and work well on a modern TV.  I picked up a used console or just $60 and a cable for $13.  Quite reasonable to keep using the volume of games that I want to play periodically.Read full review...,5

Video Game Consoles,TL;DR: Great working product! I hope it keeps up!,"My PS2 fat no longer held a charge. It wouldn't even turn on to standby after a while. It was functionally dead. I cam across the PS2 slim. But it's always a chance, when purchasing online, that you won't get the product you were hoping for...It arrived in the mail, much sooner than I expected. I waited another week for the power cord to arrive. In this time, I thought 'What if it still doesn't work? Would it be the cord or the system?'The cord came. I took it out of the package. I hooked it up to the system. It turned on standby. So far so good, but would it turn on? It did. Great, so will it play games? I loaded in an old game (Metal Gear Solid). It gave me a scare, as the disc was loading (even with the CD icon in the upper right hand corner). And then later on...success! I could play Metal Gear Solid! I could play the other games I had!Sure, one time it overheated and turned off. I played it on the envelop it came in, and got carried away with the working product before I could but it on something more efficient. But it works for now.Read full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,"PlayStation 4 - The best playstation made yet, but the worse multimedia systems Sony has ever produced.","As a Games Console, the PS4 is brilliant. Not as Good as a PC, but leagues better than the PS3 and Nintendo Switch. The graphics as amazing and the quality of the exclusive games are top notch.>However this isn't just another Games Console, where the only thing it can do is play video games, but this is a PlayStation, a brand which has been know for it's versatile systems which aren't just meant for Games, but also Music (PS1 had CD playback), Movies (PS2 had dvd playback), all other forms of multimedia support. The PS3 can stream Netflix, or a private media server, you can store movies, music and pictures on the HDD, and it can play Blurays.But the PS4 isn't the PS3, and when Sony made it, they didn't add in the other feature too. You need a separate USB to play Movies, or music. The only pictures you can view are screen shots you take in game. There's an error message when you want to watch your media server when there's no USB plugged in, and you can't listen to your Audio CD's. As a complete replacement of the PS3 the PS4 is terrible.So is a PS4 worth getting? Well if you are looking for a true successor the PS3 I'm afraid not, but as a current gen plug and play system, it does a good job, even if a PC can do it better.Read full review...",3
Video Game Consoles,Operable with significant issues,"When first purchased, the Playstation 4 worked well and I was able to play the games included along with others I have purchased. However, I have found that it is prone to constant overheating while attempting to play games. When attempting to resolve the issue by cleaning the fans and other internals, I found worn and missing screws that the previous owner likely lost in their own attempts at maintenance. Cleaning the fans to not fix the issue, I will have to take the system to a repair shop to hopefully fix these issues with the product. I think I got what I paid for, although I am not pleased with these difficulties.Read full review...",3

Video Game Consoles,Only for real gamers,"Got some small marks on the front panel, probably from tape, but for me it‚Äôs not a problem that can‚Äôt be fixed.I wanted to purchase a PS4 since The Last Of Us (2013) came out exclusively for the console, but because I already own a computer that can handle the gaming aspect, thought of it as waste of money. After watching a RDR2 trailer for a hundredth time, I forgot all about the wasting money part and went straight to EBay in hopes of finding a cheaper version.The console runs like a dream, I totally forget that it isn‚Äôt out of the box ‚Äòbrand new‚Äô. Had no problems with any connections or any updates, I logged in, updated it, bought the game, waited seven hours for it to download (the 92GB was like a slap in the face), and just enjoyed myself in general.11/10This might be it chiefRead full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Best purchase yet,"When I bought this used I thought it would be a little bruised but it was in really good shape really.

Video Game Consoles,PS4 not so great.,I have had a PS3 for many years. I took the plunge and got a PS4 500gb. Thinking that would be plenty of space to play games.I got 2call of duty games. Took a day to download the updates on 1 game. The game was fun but then needed another update. Another day. I looked to see how much memory I had and damn. 50 gb left if not less. . I wasted the money to buy this. I went back to my ps3. I can play online without having to pay.Read full review...,2

Video Game Consoles,PS4 Refurbished Review,The only downside was the controller. The left button was stuck and I didn't get the protection plan so had to buy a new controller othan that excellent product.,4

Video Game Consoles,PS4 Original Runs Smoothly Without Fail!,Although this was not the second generation or even the latest slim or UHD model it runs without locking up or failure.

Video Game Consoles,Nice college buy,I already had a PS4 shared with my brother but bought this one for me to take to college. I already had an extra controller and HDMI cord so this was the easy choice.

Video Game Consoles,Great System,"Really nice system even. I only have a few games at the moment (Uncharted 4, Ratchet & Clank and Bloodborne) all the games are great and Uncharted 4 might be the nicest looking game I've ever played. Dualshock 4 controller is ok, it's not my favorite controller (feels a bit weird for FPS) but it works fine. I also have a Xbox One but may recommend the PS4 a bit more being that it's exclusives will be only on PS4 unlike Xbox as there moving a lot of there exclusives to Windows 10. I'd recommend doing some research and seeing what games your interested in and seeing if there exclusive or not and if Sony's games look good for you know that you'll be getting a great system.Read full review...",4

Video Game Consoles,"Great product, poor psn download speed, lots of potential","I got hooked on the PS3 10 years ago. I didn't want the first build of the PS4(not an early adopter, I also waited a year before purchasing the PS3). I upgraded the HDD with a 500GB Samsung SSD 850 EVO. Load times are so fast; it's almost like ""instant on"" when I power it up.Download speeds from PSN are PATHETIC! I have a 30mbs service from my ISP. However my PS4 only reports a download speed of 611kbs. One of the games that came with the system is ""The Last Of Us""; it's been downloading for 24 hours and still reports it will be another 99 hours!. My network is hard wired with cat 6 Ethernet. My modem and router, and switches are Gigabit rated. At this time the only machine that is active on the internet is the PS4. The PC Pitstop bandwidth speed test reports a download speed of 22mbs. Why can't Sony do any better than a SLOW DSL connection? When I upgraded the HDD; I went to the Sony site to download the latest system software. It was a 700mb download on my PC. It took less than 4 minutes to download. There is something wrong with the PS4 when it comes to connectivity. When attempting to view trailers for games they offer; Sony's videos buffered every 20 seconds. I gave up trying to watch videos of games I was interested in. The trailers are best viewed on a PC. If they were working from the PS4; you can go to the store and purchase the game right there. That inconvenience could nix a possible sale from the impulse buyers among us!I'm just getting started with the PS4 and that 500GB HDD is almost half full already. Based on my experience with the PS3; I imagined that 500GB in storage would be plenty. It ain't! With only 3 games installed and 30GB of data in Que; it'll be over half full!If you've read this far, and thinking about putting in a larger HDD: go with a 2TB HDD. Especially if you want to put some music or videos in there. The only data on my HDD right now is all Sony related. I'm not sure about the PS4; but the PS3 won't make any playlists unless the music is on the HDD.Like I said in the ""bottom line""; ""LOTS OF POTENTIAL"". The graphics capability of the PS4 beats the Xbox 1, hands down. Good gaming is really all about the graphics and frame rates.I recommend the PS4. It's awesome!Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,Best video game console I have ever played!,"Its been a while since I had a video game console and stuck mostly to PC games and It kinda stuck with me for years, but after buying this console I am uninstalling all the games off my laptop and switching to this console instead. Its absolutely amazing playing games with a controller again and the ps4 dual-shock 4 is so easy to use and fits in any ones hands very easy. The Size of the console is very small actually i pictured in my head it was going to be much larger and heavier. Played Farcry 4 and GTA 5 and FF0 and they look amazing and feel great. Best console I have ever used by a long shot. Why PC game when this beast is sooo much better. I wish there where more games out but I imagine making games for this console takes a extremely long time to create for, being a Developer myself I understand this more than others who don't know about the process or making video games. The menu system is easy as heck to navigate threw and there are also some very nice options on different things to do besides gaming. Some complain about not being about to do other functions like on browse easily like on a PC or download other types of APPs that are useful for other things, but honestly just get a PC that's what there used for.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Quality game system,"Ever since Sony released the Playstation, I've been a huge fan. It has so many classic titles that never get old, never get tired of playing. Favorite game series for the Playstation is of course Metal Gear. One of the absolute best games ever made. Just wish Metal Gear Solid for PS1 would have a remake on the PS4. However, Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection is quite awesome. I saw the way Solid Snake looked on the cover, and thought maybe the graphics would be upgraded. Although that wasn't the case, the game is still awesome. Would also like a remake for the highly popular game Castlevania Symphony of the Night. Classic game on a classic system. Quite possibly the best game ever in the series. Just beat Arkham Knight and The Order 1886. Didn't get the best ending in Arkham Knight, but it was a thrill to play. The Order 1886 is the real reason I got a PS4. Games like that have always captured my attention. Also Tomb Raider, yet another classic game series. That game is, to me, an edge of your seat game all the way through. True survival game. Just wish Rise of the Tomb Raider was exclusively on PS4, since the first games came out only on Playstation. But I'm a true Playstation fan, so I'll wait for Rise of the Tomb Raider to come out on PS4. Had only one problem with Playstation and that was due to a faulty game. Other than that, every system has performed better than expected. Really like the slim PS3 as well. Had a super slim system, but the look and feel of the slim one is just so awesome. Next game on the list is The Last of Us. And maybe Rainbow Six Siege. Kinda lost interest in that game when I found it was going from an ingrown terrorism task force to more of a multi player game. But nevertheless, Sony Playstation is my favorite modern game system. Really can't say anything negative about it. Also I got a fitted controller cover that looks awesome and feels great. Highly recommended to keep your controller clean. Oh and also recommend downloading the Bionic Commando and Double Dragon Neon on the Playstation Network. Main thing is, in my opinion, the Playstation systems are top of the line. Wouldn't rather have any other system, except for the old school 8 bit Nintendo. Thank you to all who read this reviewRead full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,PS4 goodness!!,This gaming system is one of the best ever created. And i have had many fun hours of fun with this product. The flow of gameplay is phenomenal.

Video Game Consoles,GREAT CONSOLE VERY POWERFUL GREAT SALES which means more games coming....,"I've been gaming since i can remember. My first console was a original NES ""Nintendo"" I have always owned two or three console of the same generation. So I've played many hours with different consoles so I like to think I can compare them without being bias.I got the PS4 the first day it launched. I think it launched with great games, if not one of the best launches of consoles. I had everything from Call of Duty, Battlefield, Killzone, Need for Speed, Assassins' Creed, Resogun.None of those games felt like next generation, well maybe Killzone but I think Infamous Second Son and MGS are the first true NEXT GEN games for the PS4. I played them and completed the games and they really makes use of the PS4 Power.Starting Up the PS4 is super fast compared to any other console out there right now. I love how fast you can go in and out of the game. You can check your trophies really quick this time around. Sony has learn from all the mistakes they did with the PS3The Controller for the PS4 is one of my favorite all time. I love how the analog sticks are made with the indention so it keeps your fingers from coming off. The L2 and R2 greatly improved from the PS3 i enjoy playing shooter games more now.The only thing I dislike about the PS4 is that there are no major RPG games out yet and Minecraft is not out for it yet. But that will change later this year. There are plenty of awesome indie games on the PS4 some of them are FREE so I can't complain about that.Read full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,"PS4.8 core processor, 500GB Ram, Jaguar Graphic card. Best home console yet","So I've been a long time gamer. Being that said I'm going to be honest about my review. I have been with Sony Playstation since the beginning, PS1. I own a PS2, PS3, and now the PS4. The new improvements to begin with is the user friendly interface. PS4 offers a much simpler interface compared to PS3 in my personal opinion. I like how quick the machine loads, it's a beast at loading with an 8 Core processor. The Jaguar Graphics card is very good crisp and clear. I suggest running this system on a 1080p resolution HD TV to get the best quality picture. I have purchased two games so far on launch: Killzone Shadow Fall. I highly suggest this game for multiplayer much more of the story which don't last that long only 10 chapters. But there is plenty of extra to do. The graphics are very clear, but honestly for 2013 going on 2014 I was expecting a more powerful Graphics card. With that being said the work on PS4 began in 2008. I am really looking forward to next years titles, I think Playstation is going to deliver on this console big time and personally I think is going to win the console war for this current 8th generation. The price is right $399.99 USD on launch. Offers Blue Ray dvd and regular dvd such as last time. All games are made on Blue Ray discs now, reason being is massive amounts of data to put on the disc, not sure the exact number capacity and each game variates depending on the how long the game is, details such as texture map etc. I have no problem with PS4 such as overheating, plenty of cooling fans, no red ring of death like xbox 360 did. I love the design and the new controller is way more advance, I love the new dualshock 4 controller! It features a built in speaker which interacts with gameplay, better rumble features built into the controller. The most unique feature about the controller is the touch pad which is awesome in Killzone with your drone. The most unique feature I found out so far with PS4 is being able to stream live with Twitch.tv a website for gamers to show off their gameplay footage live steraming. The only problem I have encountered is some technical errors when streaming live sometimes on twitch.tv and other errors, which I'm sure in time will be patched being brought to Sony's attention. What makes PS4 different from PS3 is in order to play games online you must pay $49.99 per year for Playstation Plus. I think it kind of sucks they started doing that but all and all might improve, hopefully, our online gaming experience. I love how you can upgrade the Memory easier. A few complaints I have is not being able to play music Cd's and uploading mp3 songs. Now they charge with this music program called ""Music Unlimited"". I am very pissed off that PS4 isn't backward compatible with PS3 games. That is by far my biggest complaints. Other than that your looking at the most powerful home console of this 8th Generation. I recommend picking up Need for Speed Rivals, Killzone Shadow Fall, and Resogun, which is downloadable on the PS4 network. Downloading games is much faster and simpler as well! A must own for this 2013 Christmas! Enjoy your PS4, I know I will!Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,Powerful console with cool features. Needs more games and more local co-op!,"I bought this because I got a PS3 pretty late in the console generation (December 2011) after having an Xbox 360 for about 4 years and realizing that I liked playing some games on it more than I liked their Xbox 360 counterparts. I also thought there was a better selection of exclusives (Demon's Souls, Uncharted, The Last of Us, Killzone, Resistance, God of War, Infamous, Little Big Planet, Metal Gear Solid 4, Ratchet and Clank, SOCOM, etc.), whereas the 360 only had a few (Halo, Gears of War, Forza, Kameo, and a few PC ports like Left 4 Dead and The Witcher 2: Assassin's of Kings). Also, generally, Sony is just better to its customers than Microsoft is.After hearing about the PS4 getting exclusivity rights to Bloodborne (which is being developed by the same company and with a similar gameplay aesthetic to Demon's Souls and Dark Souls), I decided to go with the PS4 as my next-gen console of choice as the Souls series is one of my favorites. The PS4 was also a decent amount cheaper than the Xbox One and had more interesting exclusives to me, like Infamous: Second Son and Killzone: Shadowfall. That combined with the fact that TigerDirect was having a flash deal on Ebay where the console was $40 off (and didn't have any sales tax!) convinced me to jump on getting one now instead of later. Plus, there were some fantastic looking remasters of PS3 games coming out that looked like they might be worth a buy instead of their original versions, namely The Last of Us and Grand Theft Auto V.Unfortunately, I have yet to find a reason to purchase a second controller, which has left me feeling that the console might as well not even have the option to connect multiple controllers. I grew up playing local multiplayer (especially co-op) with my brother and we have yet to find any games that allow us to play together on the console even though it has been out for almost a year. There are a few like the downloadable title Octodad: Dadliest Catch and the updated version of Injustice: Gods Among Us, but neither of us are big fighting game fans and the cooperative portion of Octodad loses its luster after a few playthroughs. As cooperative multiplayer is my favorite part of video games, I really hope they eventually give me more of a reason to get a second controller.Another negative thing about the console is that it has a very weak selection of games to appeal to most audiences. I have thus far only purchased two video games (Infamous: Second Son and Killzone: Shadow Fall) for the console. I feel that there aren't many more games set to arrive in the coming months and I would really like to build up my library if possible, but not much is looking appealing. It'd be cool if they would get some more decent action/shooter games and RPGs out, especially since I think they would appeal to a large portion of the people who have a PS4.Read full review...",4

Video Game Consoles,"Good console, but not much else","Very nice gaming console, but it is not the media powerhouse that PS3 is. Games are crisp and clear, and it does seem to be very quick when loading internet pages and such, but there seems to be an issue with Sony itself. It appears they don't care about anything but playing games and selling their content (music unlimited). For instance there is no flash support, meaning you cannot watch YouTube videos. Also, apps are very limited and Sony seems to be tight-lipped or downright hostile to the idea of adding third party content to the PS4's capabilities. I tried running Pandora from their website and was greeted with a redirect error that will not let the webpage load. All-in-all a good console but not much else here. Don't sell your PS3, for you will be disappointed with the lack of basic modern technologic performance, not to mention the lack of backwards compatibility.Read full review...",3

Lenses,Better than expected,"I'd watched and read several reviews for this lens. Most were positive, though some not. No doubt, it's not Sony's best lens, but it's very good and suits my needs perfectly well for the price I can afford. I have the kit 16-50 and 55-210 lenses for my A6000, along with Sony 50mm/f1.8 and Sigma 30mm/f1.4 primes. The primes are my favorite and sharpest lenses, but I needed a good walk around lens...and that means a zoom going from wide to some telephoto. This 18-105 gives me the focal range I need. While the f4 isn't in the ""fast"" lens category, it still does VERY well in lower light (I shoot a lot in nightclubs), and the constant aperture means changing the focal length isn't going to choke my light coming through the lens as I zoom in. I look forward to many years of great photography using this lens and highly recommend it for any A5000/5100/6000/6300/6500 owners.Read full review...",5
Lenses,Very Versatile Lens,"I have two of the Sony SEL E PZ 18-105mm f/4 G OSS (SELP18105G) Lenses.I use this lens on a Sony pwx-fs5 wherever a f4 lens is fast enough, and I use it on a Sony a7sii on a gimbal stabilizer.  It is especially nice that the exposure remains constant over the full range of the zoom.  The focal length of 18-105 is sufficient on both cameras, particularly since they both have the Clear Image Zoom.  In very low light situations I will switch to a faster lens.It would be nice when turning the camera on if the zoom was the same as when you turned the camera off, but it comes on in full wide by default.  Over all, very happy with the lens.Read full review...",5
Lenses,Near great overall lens,"The Sony 18-105 is a pretty good overall lens. It's a good photo lens and an excellent video lens. The power zoom works well and is very quiet. Photos with this lens will not be at the same quality of a 55 1.8 lens but the overall usability of this lens makes it a great choice for a one and only lens. Sharpness is good with very little CA. The bokeh is pretty good and the image quality is G lens typical....which is better than the standard lenses. Overall build quality is good and the lens is pretty light for its size. The great thing about this lens is its focal length which makes it so useful for most photos and the f stop of 4 which makes it a near great video lens. This lens does not extend like some of the other lenses that are adjustable and that I like. The only problem with this lens is that when you shut the camera off, it reverts back to 18mm and not where you shut it down. There is no indicator other than on screen where the lens is at any moment.If you are looking for a lens that can be your go to every day lens, then this is probably the best choice. It does everything well.....not great but good enough and adjustable enough to make it a good value and a near great lens.Read full review...",5
Lenses,The sony 18-105mm f. 4 PZ OSS; not expensive and it is a very good lens,"This is the only E mount lens that covers this focal length spread and it overall has very good optics and build. Sure, Sony made compromises and this resulted in some distortion and light fall off on the edges, some CAs for high contrast edges, but the JPEG engine does a good job at correcting all this if set for it in the very fine Nex 6. The lens also is profiled in ACR so you can tweak raw images in Lightroom. I shoot JPEGs with the lens anyhow. The lens rewards with quite sharp images and you should have no complaint there. I also use a 32mm Zeiss Touit with a Nex 6, and although this prime is extraordinarily sharp, the Sony 18-105mm can match its color. This is a sign that Sony was serious about giving the photographer something very important: great color reproduction. For this alone, it is well worth a few tradeoffs. Right out of the camera, the color is terrific.It should be noted that well read reviewers are often quick to offer the limiting factors of zoom lenses versus the prime. This was dispelled a few years back when Olympus offered up the 50-200MM SWD,the 14-35SHG, the 12-60mm SWD, and even their 11-22mm HG. A tad slower than a fast prime,these lenses are simply astonishing in their sharpness.  Nostalgia for the old primes, you say? These Olympus lenses have resolution you only dreamed about just a decade and a half back.As for the Sony 18-105mm: if you can't get great images for big prints from it, it's the photographer's skill at fault, not the lens. One final note: You can operate the very quiet power zoom or use the rubber collar. It really is just a matter of what is comfortable and efficient for you.Read full review...",5
Lenses,Good lenses for Sony a6000.,"The a6000 is my #2 of 4 cameras. I like it enough to purchase some additional lenses aside from the two basic zooms.The SELP18105G is a smooth operating, sharp auto zoom. I have used it for stills and video. Although I try to avoid zooming while in video mode, this is an extremely quiet lenses ... much more so than the SELP 1655 stock lense.It looses one ""star"" due to barreling and pinching at each end of the spectrum. It does seem to be somewhat corrected by the camera.The f4 max aperture is a bit slow and requires an indoor flash. However, it is f4 throughout the entire range of the lense. This is a bonus at 105 mm (154 mm in 35 mm format)I use this system for my easier jobs and it performs well.Buy it ... don't hesitate unless you want the more expensive lenses for this camera. I reserve that money for the DSLR.One more note: this lenses is made in China. Don't be confused by the ads that stay ""for Japanese market."" That means, made in China for sale in Japan. Weigh the warranty differences before buying.Read full review...",4
Lenses,Great upgrade from the Kit Lens!,"This lens is a great step up from the Kit lens. Constant f4 apeture, power-zoom, and great build quality. It's filter size is pretty huge though.It's great for video (with the Powerzoom slider and OSS stabilization), and no externally moving parts. I would say the one downside is that the zoom ring is a bit touchy, and zoom speed is accelerated, so if you turn the ring faster, it zooms faster, as opposed to a straight 1:1 of turn to focal-length. Otherwise, I'm loving the lens, it's quickly becoming my all-around go-to.Read full review...",5
Lenses,Great walk-around lens!!!,"I'm so far loving this lens for it's ability to stay sharp at all focal lengths and is the perfect all-around lens I've needed.  I've mainly been using prime lenses, 30mm and 50mm, to get used to having to physically get near or be far from a subject but found it wasn't always getting it for what I needed, which I'm constantly walking around conventions and in need of being able to adjust on-the-fly without constantly changing lenses.  It's only been a few weeks but I can say that I have not been disappointed.  Recommended.Read full review...",5
Lenses,Great lens,"This is a great all purpose lens for video as well as stills. If you like to manual focus this lens is a little difficult to use. My main con with this lens is that when you turn the camera off the focal length returns to 18mm. Not a big problem, but just something to adjust to. It is stunningly sharp, beautiful bokeh, and fast af. You will not regret purchasing this lens especially if you are on a tight budget!Read full review...",5
Lenses,Sony 18-105mm f4 G purchase,"The lens is as good as described and optically sharper than expected when compared to the images of the same type of zoom lens I borrowed from a fellow photographer, I know. It shows a couple of minor scratches on the lens barrel, but all in all, almost as new. Power zoom worked well typical for this product from Sony. Happy üòÉ with the purchase, no disappointment here.Read full review...",5
Lenses,great value,"Coming from using a Canon camera for several years the size and weight of the a6000 camera and 18-105 lens combination is refreshing.  The zoom is reasonably fast and the pictures are crisp (to my novice eye).  The F4 is nice too.  I don't find the lens/body combination unwieldy at all.  I can't wait to get out and do some ""real"" shooting with this lens instead of around the home and office.  I'll be taking this lens to Disney in a couple months for the flower festival where I will really put it through the paces between pictures of my wife, I'floral pictures, fireworks, and the animals at Animal Kingdom.  I would recommend this lens to anyone looking for a mid telephoto zoom that can be carried around all day.Read full review...",5
Lenses,Great lens with a slow zoom !!,I liked a lot this lens that I am using with a SOny A6300. My only two concerns are the size and the speed of the zoom. For sure it is not a compact lens so expect to buy a new protecting case and need extra room for your camera.The second concern is that the zoom is not so fast as your fingers.. and so as you go from 16 to 105 and you like to catch a picture fast some time you may loose the momentum as zoom is slow even if using it manuallyBut is a cool lens and I will keep itRead full review...,4
Lenses,Sony G Series 18-105mm is a great all-around lens,This lens is a must for Sony Alphs series camera owners. Its versatile and can work in many scenarios. The zoom function is a great touch and gives a very smooth movement on the zoom. Great purchase!,5
Lenses,Great all all around lens for evryday use.,"I'm very happy with the lens. As other reviews stated it is big and bulky. That is the reason I gave it 4 out 5 stars. It is great to be able to use one lens for traveling. Normally I use the 35 or 50 mm F1.8 primes, which I love.Read full review...",4
Lenses,"Sharp, fantastic for video, great focal range","I find this lens to be quite sharp, plenty for my needs. The fly-by-wire zooming takes a little while to get used to, but once you get used to it you can zoom just as well as with a standard lens. The video zoom switch is very smooth. Optical SteadyShot leads to smooth videos even handheld, and sharper photos.Overall, it's sharp enough for my needs and quite good for both photos and videos. I would have a much smaller lens if you need to be more inconspicuous at an event, and it's kind of heavy, but I would definitely recommend it.Read full review...",5
Lenses,Great all round lens,I've only had this lens for a couple of weeks but I love it. This will probably stay on my A6000 camera all the time. It seems well built and very smooth to zoom. Didn't realize the zoom ring keeps turning even though you've reached the 105mm zoom range but getting used to that. It is a very nice lens and sharp.Read full review...,5
Lenses,"Great lens, excellent quality.","This lens is pretty amazing, the 18 to 105 focal length gives you some pretty good range. This lens is very high quality.

At least it's not a variable aperture.Read full review...",5

Lenses,For those who enjoy blinddating and some work of slow pace.,"Sharp lens with large front element and lens hood.   No weather sealing, and given a big deep groove like a dry river ready for a flood of rain.  It is a Sony lens, so the lens coating has different color to Zeiss T* coating.  Note that even Cosina has coating of primary colors like Zeiss.  this lens still deals with direct sunlight, flare and glare very well.E-mount lens -  very slow for focusing.  Can die many times before having subject focused for suitable press snap.Sad that Sony opted for rings without any calibration.  Feels fiddling in the dark all the time.Interesting photos with lots of pin cushioning.It is made in China.  Still a sharp lens.Packaging comes with just a bubble wrap pocket; achieving a very small box.  Feels very cheap and slightly less protected.This one came from Japan, with no warranty(card).  So, beware of gray market products!  Could cost you if anything goes wrong especially within warranty period.Read full review...",5
Lenses,Great Lens with a6500,"Bought this lens mostly for video work. It's awesome. Sharp, focus is spot on and changes naturally in video mode on the a6500. For photo work it also focuses fast and spot on.I managed to save 75 bucks from the local cost with free shipping, so even better. Offers the most versatile zoom range, yet shoots like a prime lens at each focal range, including macro.The f4 is was a turn off but I am able to push the iso on the sony, so I took a chance with it.f4 keeps things sharp and I am still able to get nice bokeh.  For anyone doing video, this lens is amazing - the smooth zoom also works well - like a video camera zoom - totally usable in productions,Read full review...",5

I was having difficulties deciding to either get this lens or Sony Zeiss 16-70 Lens. This lens is not as wide but it sure does reach a lot farther.

Digital Cameras,Awesome compact point-and-shoot!,"I'd rate this a 5 if it had faster shutter speed, but for a compact point-and-shoot, something is going to be sacrificed.  I like the size of it, the features and Zeiss lens, and the overall ease of use.  I would not say that it's ready to go right out of the box; there are some settings that the photographer will find helpful that aren't explained well in the small booklets that come with it.  For that reason, I bought and recommend the book ""Photographer's Guide to the Sony DSC HX80 and HX90"" by Alexander White.  I've just started the book and I've taken only a few pictures, but I'm pleased with them.  I know when I have learned more, I will be doing more with it besides quick shooting in the Intelligent mode.  The electronic viewfinder is a must for me because glare can reduce visibility on screens, and that can compromise your ability to get a good picture.  I also like that it has a pop-up flash and a flip-up screen for easy selfies.  I don't think I would have bought it new because of the price, but I got an excellent used one that, so far, has not disappointed at all.Read full review...",4

Digital Cameras,Versatile point and shoot camera.,"I have not had enough time using this camera in order to provide a comprehensive review of all of its capabilities.

I have used the auto setting only and the image and colors seem very good. I like that it has a view finder in addition to a screen. The latter swivels to easily allow selfies although not as convenient as your smart phone and selfie stick. I bought it for those quick and unexpected situations where you don't have the time to change lenses, set the aperture, etc., although one has many manual and semi-manual settings to choose from. I use three different cameras depending upon my desires: a dslr, a camcorder, and this P &S, that replaces an old Kodak that also took excellent pictures, but became outdated.

Video Game Consoles,Metallic Red PS Vita,"This is my 3rd (and favorite) PS Vita, the finest portable game unit ever made (better than my Nintendo Switch, which I also love)! This ""Metallic Red"" model is stunningly beautiful, functional, with a beautiful, bright, colorful screen, and hundreds of games (I had over 200 of them, both physical gamer cards and digital downloads, which I continue to purchase!) This unit came ""near mint,"" from a store's show case, and it's literally flawless, new-in-box! Sure wish that Sony had supported this system - I'll be enjoying my Vita for many years! Buy one while you can, prices are going to rise, and it'll be harder to find mint units! I'd also record the 64gb memory cards - expensive, yes, but there's no other choice. I have one in each of my Vita!Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Great Handheld: PS Vita PCH 1000,"Pros: Fun console, light weight easy to stash in your pocket and take on travels. Charming menu music; very nostalgic, reminiscent of the Wii menu music. Vibrant OLED screen with touch capabilities for the back of the console and front screen. Innovative touch controls using sliding motions for many games. Front and back camera are decent for their time. Good console to hack. Has various benefits when connected to a PS3 or PS4 consoles such as remote play. Great collectible console for Song and PlayStation fans. It can connect to wifi for online gaming and purchasing games. Has various types of apps for music, games, videos, and photos.Cons: This particular model does not come with internal memory, so its necessary to buy a 1st party memory card which can be costly. This model also uses his own type of charger, it cannot be charged using USB etc. Some PS Vita consoles may suffer from a defect in the screen causing black spots (Mura effect) that may be a minor eye sore to some, it is most notable during dark areas in games such as loading screens. As an older console. it is losing developer support as such Sony has not made many new apps and development of games has slowed, if not stopped.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,Amazing prodcit,"Did take awhile for it to get here, but I didn't mind this to much. Once it arrived I found that the Vita was well packaged and didn't seem to have any crack in the screen or anything.

Video Game Consoles,Great On-The-Go Fun!,"The PS Vita is great for portable gaming, with very powerful hardware. And, this one being the PCH-1000, it has a better screen than the newer models.

But even the newer models barely have and internal storage, so you'd end up getting a memory card anyway.Read full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,Awesome,"I purchased this same exact model & cant tell you how much I love this device. I am a color freak, which I found the black version to be boring looking & felt that the red version was better looking. While I have found some pretty sweet games for the system & the game selection is getting better, being able to play games that look like PS3 & PS4 graphic qualities is unreal. The battery life may be short but many of the games that have more advance graphics are going to use more energy from the battery alot faster. Other than that loving the OLED screen more than the LCD screen of the new version & being able to earn trophies on the go is pretty cool too. The only complaint is that you will need a big memory card for games & while the cards are not cheap, not having alot of room on a card for games, movies, & music can be a huge pain at times. I could go on & on & on about how great this system is, but I have to say that Sony hit the mark, 100% right on & the professional reviews that had bad things about this device really dont know what they are talking about.Read full review...",5

Digital Cameras,Sony Mavica MVC FD90 1.3 Megapixel,"Like:  Easy to navigate menus, easy use, GREAT picture quality at 640 X 480 resolution.  LOTS of pics on a 1.44 mb floppy at low resolution.  Excellent for listing items on Ebay.  Lens on this camera is fantastic.  Great, awesome camera.  Easy transfer of images to computer on your floppy disks.  Backup is automatic as floppies are kept on items. Li-ion batteries in this camera rock.  The 12X zoom is excellent.  I have to remind myself to use the macro setting.  Clear, clear images.  Lots of detail at low resolution.Dislike:  Old technology.  Lots of noise in image at low light levels.... candlelight that is....  New cameras like this do not exsist... bummer.  Bulky, heavy.  Hard to find reliable floppy disks that write and rewrite reliably.I decided to purchase this camera because of reviewing and using a buddy's Sony Mavica FD 75.  NOTHING beats this camera for image clarity at low resolution.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,"Mavica, simplicity and dependability in close-up work","Mavicas are the least sexy-looking camera in the world - in fact, they appear to have been designed for the Russian Army - but for the sort of work I do - ultra close-up work with coins and jewelry, they are unsurpassed in their function and simplicity.  I began photographing coins almost 10 years ago.  I noticed that the coin-images on ebay were of exceptionally variable quality - some were great and some were, not to put too fine a point on it, poop. I wrote to about a dozen sellers whose pictures actually looked like coins asking them what sort of camera they used.  Of the 6 who responded, 5 said ""Mavica"".  I duly bought a used FD-71 and have had nearly a decade of faithful, nearly daily service from it.  The ability to plug the cheap abd simple 3.5"" 1.44 HD floppy storage medium into nearly any computer and use the images without the necessity of any additional software intervention and/or cable salad issues - despite my children laughing at old Dad for his piles of floppies - are as easily used and manipulated as any other medium I have ever seen - easier than most, in point of fact.  My old FD-71, with all-of its 0.6 (yes, that's really ""point 6"", six tenths of a single megapixel) megapix resolution is adequate for virtually any web use, since I am able to focus at so short a focal length that by completely filling my frame with my subject excess background is virtually eliminated right in the camera - what good is a gazillion megapix camera if you have to leave all those pixels lying on the ""photoshop floor"" when you crop-out the background, etc?  In recent years, I have upgraded to FD-85's, 90's and 91's, and find them also to be simple, easy and ""comfy"" cameras - the 90 is especially good for my work as it has manual focus capacity, although the 85 & 91 can still get in right close-up and do a great job with miniscule subject matter.  I have read all the forgoing reviews and all the non-positive ones seem either to be complaints about shady dealers or the sorts of issues morons are likely to have - trying to plug the battery in upside-down, not charging the battery, not removing the lens cap, etc.  Truly, if you can't get great results from a Mavica, it's likely that either the camera is malfunctioning (they're so dependable that this is seldom an issue) or your brain is - a simpler, more user-friendly camera is hard to imagine.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,FD90 is a good camera but the FD92 is better.....,"I looked on eBay to find a replacement for my FD90 I bought back in 2000 for $600 to use for taking pictures of job sites. It worked great for this type of work because of the 1.6 or smaller pixel sizes and its ease of use along with the floppy drive system. The ability to record images on to the floppy was much better because we would just turn the floppies over to the person in the office that needed them, It was also easier for us going through the trouble of transferring them over USB or from the memory stick at the time to a computer. Because of the smaller pixel size, we did not need to go through compressing any of the pictures if we needed to send them via E-mail as well. The only problem I had with the FD90, and why I needed a new one was the read/record head that reads the data from the floppy broke and Sony wanted nearly $200 for repairs. This was my FD90s only problem. The replacement I bought from eBay was listed as a FD90 but it was a FD92 instead, I knew this from the photos when I bought it. It has only one drawback compared to the FD90, and that is the lack of a manual focus override. The FD92 is only Auto Focus, but this has not been a problem with me. The FD92 is better in every other way because of the ability to run a floppy and a memory stick with the flip of a switch. It is true dual media capable. It will also transfer files via USB to the computer as well. It records images way faster then the FD90 ever did regardless if you have the optional memory stick floppy adapter for the FD90. The FD92 also has a Macro like the FD90 did for very close up shots like taking picture of serial numbers or model numbers off of the equipment like I needed to do. Most of today's cameras have lost the Macro feature and if it does still have it, you will be going through tons of menu items to find it. The FD90 and FD92 achieve this with one push of the button. Out of all six of my digital cameras I have, The FD90 and FD92 are the easiest to use and best camera suited for the above mentioned type of jobs. There are much better cameras today for high resolution shots, and have way more features, but the FD90 and FD92 are the best for what I use them for.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Mavica FD90...Great all around camera,"I have 5 Mavica FD cameras and use them mainly for eBay pictures. Have spares in two different locations plus an FD95 for sunset shots. These cameras take VERY GOOD close up pictures and are great for changing light situations such as sunsets, as the settings are fast and simple to set. Much better than my expensive Nikon and also takes much better close ups. I bought extra ones on eBay because of the fear of not having an operating one for eBay. The only problem I have had with a couple of them was ""format error"" when inserting a floppy disc and have to make sure it is in and ""set"" before will accept it. No troubles so far with this FD 90.  Kennewick man...Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Sony Mavica MVC FD90,"This is a very easy camera to use. You have instant access to your shots as they are recorded on to a 3.5 Floppy Disk. This camera takes splendid pictures and the colors are magnificent.Many folks have abandoned these cameras in favor of the newest models. Personally I like these because of their ease of use. Transferring from disk to PC is simple, and even though the newer computers do not have a floppy drive, you can still purchase the floppy drives at many stores and online as well. They are no hassle to plug into your computer, and unplug when you are finished.These cameras are well built and with proper care, will last for many years. I'm a picture buff and enjoy taking shots of anything that catches my fancy. The Mavica is ready to aid me in my adventures, and I don't have to wait to see what I've captured. If it's not to my liking, I can delete it and try again.For simplicity and ease of use you can't beat the Mavica Cameras.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,GREAT CAMERA,"I bought it several years ago for web project, it served me really well. Everything is well made, unlike some other cameras this one feels very solid, no flimsy parts.

Video Game Consoles,"If you have big hands, this isn't for you.","Picked up one of these to add to my collection, and while it was fun for a short time it wasn't long before I resold it. These remind me of the old sidekick phones the way screen slides out. Graphics and screen are decent, but the controls are really small and your hands will cramp up after any kind of extended play time.This model doesn't utilize a UMD drive so if you're upgrading from an older PSP and have a library of games, this isn't for you either (unless you know how to rip your games and convert to ISO format). WiFi on these are garbage just like on the older models, and the proprietary M2 memory card situation is no good either due to price & availability.If you can find one that's in decent condition, and you don't mind cramping your hands whilst playing games then by all means go get you one of these bad boys. Load it up with custom firmware and some emulators and you're good to go!Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,PSP Go,"The PSP Go is byfar one of the most inovative techno gagets on the market today. Sony has taken the there origional PSP and completely redesigned it into a smaller more mobile gaming device while keeping best features of the origional.My favorite feature of the PSP Go is that it no longer requires the use of UMDs. Instead of having to carry around numberous amounds of games and movies, everything can now be downloaded directly to the PSP G0s internal flash memory.Also it now uses the smaller m2 memory cards instead of the pro duo memory cards. A minor change but a nice one at that. The PSP Gos memory can also be doubled! It comes with 16gb internal flash and is currently able to hold up to 16gb more with a m2 card giving you a whopping 32gb of memory, which will be necessary with the memory consumption of the downloadable games and movies.Another feature, one that im a little sad about, is that the screen is half and inch smaller. It not bad, the resolution stays the same but it takes a little bit of time to get used to if your used to the origional PSP.No more battery level percentage indicator.Now i dont know if its just me, but i think the graphics are just a little bit better than the origionals. It may just look like they are because the screen is smaller but im not sure. They do look better though.The usb has also changed, instead of using the standard mini usb slot it now uses a its own PSP adaptor. Personally i think this is a bit of a downer, i own many usb mini usb cables and now im reduced to using just the one that came with the PSP unless i go buy another, its ok as long as i dont ever forget my cable or just plain lose it.Bluetooth, yep the PSP Go now uses bluetooth. For all of you who know what it is, it opens up a small new way to interact with your PS3 and other object. The bluetooth also enables you to connect a PS3 controller to your PSP so that you can stand up ur PSP and use the controller instead. This is nice because the PS3 controller is bigger and better for people with bigger hands.Which leads me to.... The controles are alot closer together which is a bit rough for the gamers with larger hands. It takes time to get used to, and hand cramps are more frequent but its not bad.All in all the PSP Go is a great system. Sleek design meets universal functionality. Only flaw is the cramped controls.If you dont already own a PSP then you may consider the Go, if you are a current owner of a origional PSP and its the 2000 or 3000 version then upgrading isnt really necessary.Keep in mind this is all in my OWN personal opinion is and is not to be reflected onto anyone else.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,Great system but dont upgrade if you already have a psp,"Sleeker, slimmer PSP design; 16GB of internal storage; expansion slot for additional memory; Bluetooth connectivity; good integration with PS3; can access multiple downloaded games without needing to keep bulky UMDs at hand; you can pause and resume game states. Pricey, despite lack of touch screen and second analog stick; smaller screen (but same resolution); awkward placement of analog stick, volume, and display controls; unable to play UMD games or use old PSP accessories; uses obscure and expensive Memory Stick M2 format for memory expansion; battery not user-replaceable; slow download times for large games; online store not as intuitive as others. The PSP Go is a sleek and sexy redesign, but its high price tag and some frustrating caveats mean it's not a must-have upgrade for existing PSP owners--at least for now.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,"Already own a PSP? Don't get the PSP GO. If not, it is a great product.","The PSP Go is a great handheld and offers a all around better experience for those new to Portable Playstation games. It has many games to offer on the Playstation Network (PSN) and can hold all of which on its 16 GB memory. This is a great plus because unlike the previous PSP's (1000-3000) you need to buy a separate memory stick just to start saving games. The upside to downloading your games onto your PSP directly is you don't need to lug around the UMD discs for each individual game. The downside to the PSP GO and PSN is that not all the games are on the Playstation Network, and the PSP GO doesn't offer a way to play games that you already own on UMD disc. So the biggest complaint people will have is that they have to re-buy any games they wish to play on the PSP Go, and their UMD discs would be all wasted.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,PSP Go Portable Media Player and maybe a little gaming.,"First the PSP Go should not be considered as a replacement for a PSP(1000, 2000, or 3000). The PSP Go is more of a portable media device with some light gaming, exactly what I bought it for. I wanted something I could watch movies on, play music with and if I felt like it maybe play a game.The GoodThe PSP Go is small, I mean carry in your pocket small. The screen may be a bit smaller than the original, but it is just as sharp and clear and plays movies beautifully. Has 16gb(about 14gb usable) internal memory and still has a m2 card slot that can expand the memory I believe another 32gb. That is a lot of movies, music, and games. The bluetooth will let you connect a bluetooth headset or the ps3 bluetooth earpiece to make skype calls or watch movies in bed with out waking the wife. Without having a UMD drive the battery last longer and does not take forever to load a game (this drove me nuts on the PSP)The BadPlaying a game for an extended length of time will leave your fingers in knots. The controls are very close together and the devise is so slim and small there is not a lot of machine to hold on to leaving you feeling like you always need to adjust to get a better hold on it. No UMDs means all those games you bought will not be played on the new PSPgo, oh well there had to be a trade off.Warning: I did a lot of research on the PSP go before I bought it. When looking on Ebay for a used unit, a lot of sellers were selling PSP with tons of movies and games preloaded on the device. Doing some research in some PSP forums I found that to keep all of that stuff you cannot activate the device on the Playstation Network otherwise it will deactivate all of the games and movies(if legally purchased anyway)on the device. I bought mine and it was loaded with Assassins Creed and the minute I activated it the game could not be played. So unless I missed something be sure to just bid on the device and not all the media unless you plan to never sign on to the PSN.Hope this review helps you decide.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,Appears to be in good order and a very nice product.,"It is an item that my middle son apparently wants for Christmas, as w/ any child, things become more expensive as they age... I think it is an expensive item and not really something that is needed...but if it does all that it is suppossedly able to do, it will be a good purchase for him given his age.  Curious on how well the internet access will work!  I trust that this feature will not become a problem for us in our family.  As parents we obviously are concerned w/ some of the content of the internet for sure.  I like the color, size, and design of the item, and I know from past experience that SONY generally makes a very good, quality product.Read full review...",4

Video Game Consoles,Used Psp Go,Better than the PSP 3000 in my opinion considering you can pair a genuine PS3 controller via Bluetooth and enjoy the great library of games but with better controls. M2 memory cards are pretty cheap as well so you can expand the memory by 16Gb for about $20. Component cables will cost you $15.Read full review...,5
Video Game Consoles,Very Conveniant and Compact! Love It!,"This is definitely what the meaning of ""portable system"" should be all about. It comes with 16GB of storage built in which is a ton of space for games, movies and music. You can also add storage space by means of a memory card. This system is not a favorite amongst those who like to hack the PSP systems because as of right now......you can't. So those who are cheap and are angry they can't play their pirated copies of games whine about the system. When in all actuality it is better than the pther PSP's that are out there. You just have to purchase your games through the PSN Network and it all stays stored on your system. If you can find one for about $150 don't pass up on it. It is a neat little system and offers everything you need in a portable system.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,good system but one flaw,"I really enjoyed this system when I first got it. It was sleek, easy to use, and the game choices were pretty good. However, after about 30 minutes of use my hand started to cramp up. This happened everytime I would try and play it. I wanted to enjoy it but it is just too small of a system. I think the PSP 3000 would have been a better choice for my hands. It is still an awesome system, but the one flaw was enough for me to get rid of it.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,"PSP Go. PSP-Fanatik review,","More on http://forum.psp-fanatik.ro/[img]http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/9/2009/09/500x_custom_1254159249503_pspgo.jpg[/img] Smaller, easier to use and completely devoid of a disc drive of any sort, the PSPgo is powered only by digital media, a brave step into the future of gaming. But is it a future in which we want to live?LovedPure Digital: The PSPgo is smaller, sleeker, better designed than its predecessors, but the thing that really separates it from all of the Playstation Portables that came before is its lack of a Universal Media Disc drive. Gamers will rely almost entirely on a WiFi connection to download pictures, movies, music and games to their system.Granted, you can use the Media Go software and a computer. You can use the Playstation 3 and a cable. You can even use a Memory Stick Micro to put content on your PSPgo. But those are all safety nets. This device is meant for online purchases and play.A gamer's main access point for buying content is the Playstation Store, a built-in option on the PSPgo's cross media bar. Once set-up, gamers can use a credit card or store-purchased redeemable cards, to get new content. The store, available on the Playstation Portable as well, is a well constructed digital shopping center that makes finding and grabbing the content you want a breeze.Over the course of a week I purchased TV shows and games, rented a movie and downloaded demos from my home in the U.S., airports abroad and even the press room of the Tokyo Game Show. Getting content onto the device with a wireless connection from virtual anywhere was a breeze. And with five games, four demos, some music, pictures and a TV show and movie, I still had 9 of the 16 built-in gigs of memory free.Accessing the content is also a breeze, with a folder for system storage and another for the Memory stick. Within each folder are icons for the games already installed.The system of downloading, installing and playing full blown games is very similar to the iPhone, though the store is much better organized and the selection much more diverse and often of a higher quality than the iPhone's game section.Feel: My more-than hour long sessions spent playing games on the PSPgo never ended in hand cramping, despite the device's smaller size. The portable has enough heft to keep it from feeling like a toy, but it's light enough to minimalize any hand fatigue.The back of the features two slightly raised ridges which make clutching the go with your fingertips a bit easier while your thumbs dance across the front of the system.The directional pad and face buttons aren't as raised and don't have as much give as the ones found on the PSP 3000, but that's something I adapted to fairly quickly. While the single analog stick is shifted over a bit, now down and to the right instead of below the d-pad, I got used to that quickly as well. The big issue will be with games that require gamers to switch quickly between that right d-pad and the thumbstick. The new location for the two will make that much harder to do. The shoulder buttons were far less clicky sounding and feeling than with the original Playstation Portable, but I felt that was a change for the better, not the worse.The button changes that did bother me a bit were the Select, Start, Display and Volume buttons. All four have almost zero give when pressed. The volume buttons, tucked away behind the screen on the top edge of the system, were hard to find andRead full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,Be prepared to learn and be frustrated!,"I bought this for my son after his PSP was stolen. The upgrade was supposed to relieve the sting of losing the other one. With the Go one has to learn the ups and downs and ins and outs of computer networking. Signing up with the Playstation Network is also required and be forwarned that this is not the site in which one will be downloading the games. Media Go is what will be used; and odds are the CD-Rom that accompanies the console will not be the most recent software; and if not, one will be asked to download the newest version and non-compliance will result in an inability to access the store or download thru Media Go. Next, do not be alarmed or suprised if even after the newest version is downloaded if access to the store becomes a problem. There are numerous programs already installed on the pc such as the firewall that may block access and it will be up to the user to figure that out and solve the problem. Tech support thru PSN is not helpful at all. Good Luck!Read full review...",3

Video Game Consoles,I am very pleased with my purchase and you will be too.,"I definitely have no regrets switching from my PsP 3000 to my new PsP Go. The ability to play Umd's wasn't an issue since I found myself buying almost all my games from the Playstation store. The battery life is just as long as the 3000, and the GO has all the same power saving features as the 3000. The addition of Bluetooth was a nice touch also, no need to have ear plug wires hanging all over the place. The 16GB internal memory is one of the best features of the GO, I can keep all my games, music, videos, and comics, installed and still have like 5GB's to spare. Plus you can still use memory sticks to expand your storage even more. The new control scheme actually works very well, and was easy to adapt to. A multitude of skins are available on Ebay, or IStyles, or Gel-Skins to protect your GO.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,"La psp, para los usuarios nuevos fanatico de las tarjet","Realmente esta PSP, es genial en cuanto a portabilidad y comodida para el consumo. Sus controles realmente no son mas comodos que los de la PSP original pero se pasa. El problema de esta maquina es que los usuarios viejos de PSP no podran desacer de su PSP con UMD pues no hay una opcion para hacer backup, y pasar tus juegos a la Go. Ni podras intercambiar juegos ni nada por esos estilos. en fin es una portatil que es restritiva con el usuario. Pero que para viajar simplemente tendras que agarrar tu cargador y vamonos liberandonos de estar cargando docenas de juegos que lo que hace es ocupar espacio. en fin a la hora de comprar una PSP go tienes que pensar que estas comprando una especie de Iphone, pero con juego de verdadera calidad.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,GoBigger GoSmaller GoDigital GoVersatile  GoAnywhere,"Go Bigger16GB flash memoryGo SmallerThe most portable PSP¬Æ everGo DigitalThe most immersive portable games, anytime, anywhereGo VersatileGames, music, movies, internet and moreGo AnywhereYour content, fitting your lifestyleThe PSPgo is scheduled to launch on October 1st in North America and Europe and then on November 1st in Japan. While bundles that pack in extra games and media are planned for the future, the system will only include a proprietary USB cable and an AC power adaptor. It's worth noting that the PSPgo is not intended to outright replace the current PSP-3000, but will instead be marketed as the ""premium"" version of the PSP.In terms of what you can do with it, the PSPgo isn't all that much different from the previous iterations of the system. It still features a single analog stick, four face buttons, left and right shoulder buttons and a D-Pad for input, and the internal processing and graphics horsepower is the same (in other words, your games will look exactly like they did before). The biggest change though is that there isn't a UMD slot anymore, so your old disc-based content won't work directly with it. Instead, you'll make use of the system's built-in 16GB of flash memory to store your games, music, images, video and more. Having all of your media right there in the system means you won't have to lug around plastic discs anymore, and because the system is smaller on the whole, it'll fit into your pocket much more easily.The most immediate thing you'll notice about the PSPgo is that the screen slides up to reveal the controls, and down again to make the system more compact. The screen snaps open and closed so it'll stay in place however you're using it, and it stays on when closed so that you can continue to watch videos and listen to music when the controls are hidden.In terms of connectivity and storage, the system features 16GB of internal memory for storing content such as games, videos, music, pictures, saved games and anything else you can throw on there. If you run out of memory, you can use a Memory Stick Micro to add more space (these are currently available in sizes up to 32GB). Bluetooth is once again included for pairing with appropriate headsets, plus there's a 1/8 inch headphone adapter and built-in WiFi.One notable change to the hardware is that there are no longer separate ports or connectors for USB, power and video out. Instead, the PSPgo has a single, proprietary connector that handles all of this for you. Simply insert the appropriate cable and you're off and running. Note that the USB cable is used for both copying content from your computer or PlayStation 3 as well as charging the system when coupled with its AC adaptor, and both items are included in the box.by IGN.comhttp://psp.ign.com/pspgo/index.htmlOrder NOW!http://stores.shop.ebay.com/Mariio128-GamemateRead full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,Sony Psp Go,"I bought the Psp Go about 2 months ago. I used to have the psp 3000 but I sold it so I could get the psp go. I love it for many reasons. One reason is it is so portable. The portable part of it is a big reason why I bought it It fits perfictly in your pocket. Another Reason that i love the psp go is because of the graphics. The graphics are great, they are the best in MLB 10 The Show but that is just what I think. Also I think that the built in 16GB memory is awesome because now I do not have to buy a memory stick. Most people think that it is bad that you have to buy games from the playstation network (psn). But really is not bad the games are a fair price and you get games without having to leave your home. The psp go also comes with a free Rock Band Unplugged voucher. I hope that this review helped you make your decision to buy the psp go or not.Read full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,Great piece of equipment.,"The PSP is really nice. It is about the size of an android or windows phone. I bought the PSP because I really liked that I could download the games and play them on the road without having to worry about taking disc games or cartridges with me. I really like how portable the device it as well as the graphics and sound quality. I didn't like how difficult it was initially to set up wifi. After two days I finally figured out you have to go to the Sony Entertainment Network website, create an account, and register/add the device through USB. As soon as I did that the wifi connected on the first try. I haven't had many hand held gaming systems but I do like it better than the DS gaming systems. Over all I am really pleased with the PSP and would recommend the product. Just make sure to register it before connecting to wifi; if you still have problems contacting Sony will be a 10-20 wait but may be worth the call or chat support.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Sony PSP Go Pearl White Review,"I am a lite user of the PSP, so having the PSP Go was a good alternative for me.  Sure, it lacks the UMD drive, but the games that are available for download on the Playstation Network are the ones I play the most.  While there are games only on UMD, some of them are not a big deal to me, except for some of the Square Enix titles like Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions and Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth, but I was able to accept that fact and move on (The PSone version of Final Fantasy Tactics is available on PSN anyway).The lack of standard memory stick was an annoyance, but memory stick micro is readily available at stores like Amazon and even eBay for affordable prices.  The button placement is not as bad as I initially thought.  I have big hands and I do not feel uncomfortable after prolong play.  The Bluetooth is a nice addition, since the use of a PS3 controller is useful in conjunction with the component cables is useful for many games.All in all, I enjoyed my purchase.Read full review...",5

I don't play video games at all but even for a non-gamer such as myself I found it fairly easy to figure out.  The graphics are incredible and love the fact that I could hook up to our wireless network on it!!!  Very cool.  I know my son is going to love it!!Read full review...,5

Video Game Consoles,"Excellent PSP, Works Perfectly, Just what I wanted","I love how you have to download the games instead of carrying them around.  You can buy them off your computer through media go, but not download them to your psp until your ready or you freed up memory.  Downloads are a lot quicker than everyone says, about 10-20 minutes for me personally.  It's perfect because it saves me the time and money from running to my gamestop.  PSP Go is a great idea and love itRead full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,yes i win the psp,"I bought the NewPhone 74205 three weeks ago and was immediately impressed with the number of features available on this inexpensive phone. It has a 1M-pixel camera, video camera, and speakerphone. The NewPhone's size is perfect for carrying in a pocket and the battery has a pretty good lifespan of roughly 4 hours. My only complaint is that the menu system on the phone makes you click four times before you can find someone in the address book, set an alarm, or perform a additional functions. Other phones I've owned have simpler menus and get you to important features easily. Overall, I'd recommend the phone if you're on a budget.Read full review...",4

Video Game Consoles,Fantastic with the right expectations.,"The PSPgo is an awesome piece of hardware, if you are aware of its limitations.  It does not play normal PSP UMD games.  There is no disc drive on a PSPgo.  There is a ton of games in the playstation store online, as well as all the playstation minis that you can buy for your PS3.  And remote play.

Video Game Consoles,"A Flawed Piece of Tech, Killed By the People Who Made It","Launching in 2012, the PS Vita was the ultimate companion to the aging PS3. Sony had a nice piece of hardware in their hands, but sadly it wasn't enough to beat the dominating Nintendo 3DS. The device never quite caught on even though it had better graphics, better features, and the backing of many develipers. It truly is sad that Sony never really figured out how to support the system, it was officially killed in 2019 when production ceased. The handheld does live on with hackers and homebrew enthusiasts.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,Meh,-Dirt gets underneath the screen like the PSP.-There is no real organization so everything is a mess like the 3DS (trying to copy the iphone -- just give us a plain text alphabetical list of all apps!-Memory card costs more than the system -- UNFORGIVABLE,3
Video Game Consoles,One of the best handhelds made,"I have to say, the PSVita is a very underrated handheld console.  It's one of the best I've ever owned!  You can download most Ps1 and PSP games from the playstation store, the games you can buy for it are just beyond amazing.  Had to get this console because of the Metal Gear HD collection, the God of War collection, and Final Fantasy X & X-2 as well as Final Fantasy 7 that you can download for 10 bucks in the playstation store.The battery life on this is great!  Lasts way longer than the 1st gen PSvita but of course doesn't have the same display as the original but still looks amazing, hard to really notice.The only downside to these are the memory cards.  They are super expensive.  The size I would recommend for people only buying physical games and a couple download games would be the 16GB memory card, anything lower is not too good and anything higher would just be a waste of money.  You could get away with the 8GB, but best to be safe with the 16GB.  The PSvita Slim has a 1GB capacity without the memory card also so you can still play and save a few games on it without the memory card at least. Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,"Love it!  Could use a few improvements, but overall thumbs up!","I have always been a PS fan since the beginning, So for a joint birthday present to both myself and husband we got a vita. The touch screen is sensitive, easy to use and the screen is vivid and clear.  The rotation feature is also pretty cool.  In an improvement from the psp the 2 analog sticks instead of 1 makes gameplay closer to a regular ps3's which is nice.  Graphics are awesome, comparable to ps3.  One thing I am not happy with is the ""cross platform"" there are only 3 or so games, which I knew when I bought it, however it is still disappointing on sonys part, not to mention their ad's for that feature make it seem a lot cooler and like you can do it with any game. The browser is fast when I'm connected to wifi (didnt get 3g) and I do like the set up of the home screen. No customization options that I can find for backgrounds though, and that would be kind of nice. I have a DS but not a 3DS and a psp.  compared to those, the vita wins hands down.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,"Amazing device, as powerful as PS3, but needs more exclusives to take off.","This machine is great, the hardware is indeed amazing and I would recommend getting this and either model is good.The lack of games is the only hard sell, if there were more titles that were exclusive then this would take off how the PSP did but due to the only games that are out are ports of the PS3 games that are already available, it's hard to justify the purchase.  There are a few for each genre but unless there is one on there you just need to have, it's a hard sell unless you get it at a really good price.The screen is great, the touch sensor is very responsive on both front and rear screens.  The device is a good weight so it feels comfortable, and the buttons/analog sticks are in very good positions.  The only thing you need extra is a memory card and a screen protector, and a good case is highly recommended to prevent unwanted scratches when not in use.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,Very Good Product-Losta Fun-Great Remains To Be Seen,"I have the PSP and was going to hold out for the vita price to drop but got a really good deal at auction.  The system is pretty awesome!  The graphics are great, the controls smooth, although there are alot of them which will take some getting used to.  I opted for the wi fi only because it is the cheaper alternative by far, not only for the system, but the 3G plan is through AT&T which is just another added expense that will never go way.  I have WiFi in my house which is good enough for me.  If I were to have any criticism about this system it would be these: 1)The piano black finish which sony insists on using is a fingerprint magnet (although much worse on the psp 3000)2)The battery cannot be replaced-unlike the psp,we shall see, although it seems to have worked for nintendo for yearsOverall, a good system, great remains to be seen as the library of games is still on the low side and many were made quickly for the launch date so they do not utilize many of the vita's features. The best handheld system to date by far (the 3ds gives me a headache) and the graphics blow the 3ds out of the water. I would suggest it as a good buy, lotsa fun.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,Best Handheld Gaming Console,"Portable gaming is really important to me, moreso than before, because of my children. Not because they want to play too, it's because the number one gaming console, prior to this purchase, was my Android phone. Now, they want to use it when we are out and about in order to watch YouTube.This little and lite machine boasts pleanty of power to spit out HD graphics and outstanding colors. The CPU allows me to use it more than it was intended for. I've modded it and now have opened it up to use for practically all gaming consoles. The battery is the only issue as it will only squeez out less than four hours of gameplay. But that should be enough for a day running errands.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,"Worth it, if the price is under $150...","The Good: Overall the Vita is a pretty solid system. The OLED screen is vivid, bright, and sharp, which is nice. The controls are very intuitive, and the touch screen is a nice feature. There is also a rear touch pad that doesn't seem necessary at times, yet could be really cool as long as games are developed for its purposes. There is also a remote play feature that would be great except for the fact that there are only a select few games available for the PS3. **Note** I have read that the PS4 will have full support on remote play. We'll see!The Bad: The games are expensive, and the selection seems weak. I hope they develop more for this platform.The Ugly: I think the system looks nice. It's well-balanced and fits readily in the hands. Although the joysticks are small, they  are surprisingly intuitive. I give the aesthetics a 5 here...Overall, with the current features on a PS3, the PS Vita scoreas a 4 for me. Maybe when I upgrade to a PS4, that missing star just may get filled in!Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,"Amazing and a lot of fun, expensive memory cards hold it back.","This is probably the funnest handheld gaming unit ever.  Ultimately games make the machine and unfortunately the Vita's game library isn't really extensive. I did enjoy the limited games the vita offers. Hopefully in the next few years there will be a lot more to come. The graphics, sound, dual analogs, and everything else is great. I even like the touch screens control in some games. It is very interactive. Three things hold it back- 1) battery life seems pretty weak, game selection at this time is a little lacking, and finally the price of memory cards is ridiculous. More games and lowering the price of the memory card would make this the greatest hand held ever.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,"Great value for its money, just not a big variety of games","I like the ps vita. it has a nice touch screen and i like to use remote play with my ps4. I think that is one of the best features. i dont like that it does not have actual l2 and r2 buttons, so it is a little difficult to play some of the ps4 games. I feel like the game selection is very minimal. there arent any nba games for it. If it had a bigger selection of games then it would receive an overall rating of 5/5. But other than the game selection it is great. I can watch youtube videos on it and go on facebook. The graphics are wayy better than the psp. Other than the limited game selections, i am satisfied with my purchaseRead full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,SONY PS PLAYER 4 LIFE,"Great invention that honestly is still better than any other hand held on the market. It is still a good buy in 2018, & in Japan it is. PlayStation has said 2 years ago that it would stop making games for it, but they still are releasing new games today. If you have a SONY PS account you get free games every month, & if you had a PS account for years hopefully you were saving those games to the cloud & now can download them to a memory card & play them anytime. One of my favorite things about the Sony PlayStation Vita is the Remote Play feature. If you're playing a game on the PlayStation 3 or the PlayStation 4 and have to go outside or use the bathroom you don't have to stop playing your game. All you have to do is pause the game, turn on the PlayStation Vita, go to either connect to PS3 or PS4, & connect to it by remote play. Now you can continue playing your game on the PS VITA wherever you left off playing at on your PS3 or PS4 console. That's how powerful and fast this little gadget is. If Sony knew how to market this handheld correctly, it would still be one of the top electronic gadgets out there on the market, but they sure don't know how to, & they never did (they did the same thing to the PSP). I guarantee you that if you get one, you will fall in love with it!!Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,"Powerful and expensive product.  Some limitations, but easy to use.","The PS Vita is one of the more expensive handheld buys, but it down pack some power in this small device.  Sadly Sony doesn't not offer any support for the purchase of physical copies of UMDs for the PSP handheld system so you are out of luck if you are wanting to try some and replay the older stuff.  Sadly, there isn't much for it currently and yet the possibilities for this thing are endless.  If you were a fan of the PSP then I would recommend getting it once the Vita has made its mark in the gaming world.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,great value if you've collected psn vita games,"I've never bought anything from ebay, let alone a used piece of electronics but this has surpassed my expectations.  I've played this a fair bit over the past weeks and it seems like new - not a single scratch on screen, the buttons and sticks feel good.   The battery is in great shape too.  If you've been collecting a free vita games catalogue over the years, it's a good time to cash in.  I was pleasantly surprised.I would give five stars except for the fact that you need the memory card.  You may be able to find one for good value.  The OLED screen is great but it doesn't show well outdoors.  The battery last about 4-5 hours - which is fair - and has a proprietary plug.Other than that, this is a great system; probably underrated  There are more than enough good to great games at this price point.Read full review...",4

Video Game Consoles,Buy it refurbished for a great value,"Yeah, so this is the older style of vita, no longer sold in stores. It has an OLED screen, which is supposed to be better than the second generation's LCD screen. Having never seen a vita 2 in person, I can only tell you that the screen picture on this one looks great. Also, it is supposed to feel more solid and substantial to hold in your hands than the vita 2. I have heard that the WIFI reception is better in this model than in the vita 2, not sure if that's true. Now onto some disadvantages: The OLED screen will supposedly burn out after a while, needing to be replaced. The USB IN port, where you plug in the charger or connect it to a PS3, PS4 or PC is a weird proprietary SONY port that will not take any kind of standard USB cable. Finally, battery life on the first generation is about an hour less than the vita 2. Oh, and accessories may be harder to get and/or more expensive than the vita 2's. These systems are not the same thickness, and some of the buttons and the speakers are a different shape. That being said, I have almost all of the top rated games and this system is fun. I also love being able to go on the PS store from the vita and browse games, themes, APPS, etc. If you get one, Know that this first generation requires a memory card to save any game data. No big deal, right? Well, the memory cards are proprietary as well- has to be a SONY vita memory card, and they aren't cheap. I was lucky and found one on closeout, brand new in a big box store. Suggest you try that or maybe a pawn shop or thrift store. To sum up, I recommend this system- contact me to find out what seller I bought from.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,let¬¥s talk about somethings of psvita system.,"Hello i want to talk you about the ps vita system, in my case i decided to buy it because my fellow psp fat has a critical malfunction, so i decided to see what could be the best portable system to replace it, in the first place i thought in buying a gamepad, you know there are emulators of psp system in android but the gamepads are most expensive than the vita, and the OS android has its issues of charge with the aplications, i look at the vita now and it can do very well most of the thinks than a gamepad can do, tha aplications are easy to use, the internet explorer is fast (if you compare to the psp is the fastest think in the earth), you can play old titles of the ps one and psp, and you can patch it to emulate your veteran psp and play the games you own but you can play in this console (it doesnt have a umd lector), but its not everything good, in the general if you want it to play it does its job, if you want it to check internet and email, its good, aplications..... well... it has few depending in the market you are signed, thats another problem, you just can add 1 account to the system, if you are of the people to like to have multiple accounts ti save money in games this could be a problem, it forces you to update the system, if you dont you cant do nothing on line (well in th ps network, check your email, navigate and watch youtube are posible without a update), thera are games that dont start without and internet connection, so if you dont have internet at home, it will better for you to check another console, thera are other games that dont start wihtout the latest update, even when you deactivate the autoupdate it starts to download it in second plane, if you live the wireless connection on. the batery is important too, it last long (with the brightness low) 8 hours, in suspending mode it could be 2 days (i forgot it suspended in my bed), buttons: there are better than in the psp, the dual sticks are soft and durable, the only bad thing that i found its, the power button, you can power on, power off and suspend the system with the same button, if you like to suspend your games very often, the button its not going to last long, the worst thing that i can tell of the ps vita is this:the memory cards are very expensive, and the capacity is low having in mind that the games, add-ons and aplications are heavy, a 8 gb card doesnt work for a gamer if you ask me (if you are lucky buying a version with a this card), tha cards are veryimportant in the vita, if you are a gamer you will need a card of 16 gb at last, but the prices are in the $35USD, add to that the pricess of the games, its a very bad point for me, and you cant use it in any console, if you try to use it in another vita you will have to give format to it (if you were thinking in handle your memory to a friend to copy the games, play it or something like that) the transfer of data between the pc and the vita is a little slow i suppose its because of that antypiracy system, but the good think is you can have all the games you purchased in your pc, so you dont have to download it again, just copy the game to your pc when you dont have free space, and when you want to play it again copy the game from the pc to your vita, it a good think if you have a big game library. im was to informal with this but i feel better doing the description like a chat, i feel more free about my opinion this way, sorry if it doesnt fit for a review for someone, but anyways thanks for reading.Read full review...",4

Video Game Consoles,Best version of the Vita so far.,"Plays North American games perfectly. The matte-finished plastic feels great on the hands, and doesn't pick up fingerprints.It uses LCD instead of OLED, so the colorspace is different. Keep in mind that most recent games are calibrated for this so they'll look more natural on the LCD screen. Also, the LCD screen is slightly more visible in direct sunlight and overcast skies compared to OLED, so you could actually play outside.One important thing to be aware of is that since this is the Japan Model, circle is confirm, x is cancel (and because of this there are a few NA games that might use circle as confirm as well, like Dragon's Crown.)Confirm/cancel buttons aside, everything is exactly the same as with an NA Vita.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,The Vita is a great  console for those looking to have gaming on the  go!,"The PlayStation Vita aims to let you take home console gaming on the go and it does just that.  With games like Gravity Rush, Killzone Mercenary, Uncharted Golden abyss, Need For Speed Most Wanted, Tearaway, Soul Sacrifice, Final Fantasy, Little Big Planet, and more. The PS Vita excels far beyond the PSP before it.Offering up dual analog sticks and shoulder buttons, front touch screen and rear touch-pad, excellent face buttons (X Circle - Square - Triangle) with D-Pad, WiFi, Bluetooth, front and rear facing cameras, and a gorgeous screen, playing the PS Vita makes gaming on the go extremely fun and rewarding.There are not many downsides to the Vita. If you own one or plan to own one, you will not be disappointed. There's a myriad of games to choose from. There's big budget AAA games, Indie games, PSP games, PS One games and PlayStation Mobile games all at your disposal.  This little powerhouse does it all. Oh, did I mention you can play nearly every PS4 game on the Vita too!? Remote play let's you zap your PS4 over to the Vita even if someone is occupying the TV!The only major con with the Vita would have to be those memory card prices. Sony uses a proprietary memory card format to try to stop piracy. Unfortunately, that comes at a price.  When you compare a 16GB Micro SD card to the price of the PS Vita Memory card, it's like night and day. The PS Vita card is substantially more expensive. We're talking a 16GB Micro-SD Card costs roughly $10 whereas the 16gb PS Vita memory card costs roughly $30  There's a huge price difference. Sony needs to address this because it's holding consumers and the console back.  It's hard to see the value in the memory cards when they cost so much and when we know there are cheaper alternatives out there.Since we are on eBay, you can most certainly find great deals on PS Vita memory cards, so don't let that push you away from buying the system. Plus! Many of them come bundled with a card now anyways. The Vita really is worth every penny. The games are fantastic and the build quality of the system are top-notch.I would most certainly buy another one. I own two already, I certainly wouldn't hesitate to buy one more if I needed it!Pros:Vast catalog of games. Able to play classics and modern games.Dual analog sticksFantastic face buttons and D-Pad - extremely well built.Gorgeous large display that will not disappointBuild extremely well with quality materialsCons:Slightly more pricey memory cardsSony doesn't market it oftenRear camera lacks in quality (it's not needed very often though)Read full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,Must have.,"A few hours since delivery... I'm impressed. Just about everything about the PSV: display, controls, features, the games - top of the line. This is a gaming machine that shouts ""quality"" and, after the first few hours of playing Uncharted and a couple of small games off the PSN, I can say that I've had the best portable gaming experience ever - we currently have a PSP and a DSi in the house plus a couple of tablets and smart phones.Briefly - and I will update my review as I experience more of the PSV - these are my findings so far.HARDWARE AND FEATURESYes, it's quad-core this, and super-high-rez display that but what counts is that it translates into a super-smooth gaming experience with a bunch of non-gaming capabilities on top. I'm surprised how immersive playing a game on such a small screen with such tiny speakers can be. And it is so for a couple of reasons.- the sharpest, best looking display I've seen on a portable- the dual analog sticks make all the difference - Sony learned from past mistakes- the back touch panel are something that it's better to experience because it's the one clear innovation on this machine and it won't give you headaches (sorry Nintendo :) )- games can be either downloaded or purchased and shared on physical media - like I said, Sony is learning from past mistakes (sorry PSP Go)- seamless integration with the PS3 and the Playstation Network- a bunch of great multimedia apps including Netflix - I'll have more to say about these after I stop playing Uncharted :)- cameras - more later but I heard that some games allow you to build characters that look just like youTHE GAMING EXPERIENCEAnyone who has a PS3 or a PSP should feel very familiar with the PSV. All the PS3 controls are there although some of the buttons are smaller. Add to that the 'touch' capabilities on both front and back with support for gestures and the gaming possibilities are almost endless. Because of its high resolution, there can be a lot happening at the same time on the PSV's screen and, don't forget, you can also feel the action while playing.I don't feel like doing comparisons at this time but anyone who claims that the PSV is no big deal because we can play games on our phones should experience the PSV and then consider revising their statements. Vita can easily play any one-dollar game that a phone can play and I'm sure we'll get a couple of those and Vita can do just about everything a smart phone or tablet can do and most of the time do it better, but no phone or tablet can play Uncharted and no 'next generation' phone or tablet is likely to be able to play Uncharted or Little Big Planet. And, let's not forget that the Vita costs a less than most smart phones.EVERYTHING ELSEI haven't had time to explore all of Vita's features yet but, they're all in there. Multimedia, wireless connectivity, music playback... it's all in there. Add to that one of the best laid out, intuitive and responsive user interfaces and even non gamers should be happy to have a Vita around.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKEA couple of things. The most annoying is, of course, the hyper-overpriced memory card. You can't play 'big games' without one and Sony decided to make lots of money on this proprietary 'must have' add-on which is anything but optional. Then there's of course Sony not making the Passport program available in the US. We have a PSP and lots of games on UMDs. Not beiRead full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,if you have any interest in this console what-so-ever... buy it!,"this system is insane. it makes a complete laughing stock out of the 3ds, even at its higher asking price. then factor in the processor is faster than an xbox360, has netflix, a second analog stick(which controls great) has a competent web browser, the cameras aren't too awesome, but they're much much nicer than a standard webcam. and a 25 game launch(second most games for a system release ever). a nice surprise about it,is it has a substantially improved directional pad, and although the face buttons are smaller than a ps3 controller, i dare say its even better for fighting games like ultimate marvel vs. capcom 3(due to the dpad). speaking of UMvsC3, its graphics are exactly as gorgeous as the PS3 version hooked up to a 37in 720p tv. i have no idea how this is possible. sony basically combined a ps3 and a tablet, with little sacrifice on either side. the screen is beautiful, and has a great touch interface. rear touch pad is fine, not really great or bad. the motion controls are pretty fun too. better than a six-axis controller motion i would say. pretty much the only thing i could say is a negative is battery life is a bit lacking, but not worse than what i expected.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,#GameChanger,"The PS Vita delivers the closest thing yet to a console-level experience in a handheld device, with well-designed handheld features. The rear touch-panel is an innovation I expect to see on other devices soon: While it takes some getting used to, it is fairly natural to use when your fingers are already on the back of the device because your thumbs are on the controls.All in all, the PS Vita really has managed to bring console-level gaming to a handheld in a way nobody has done before. I love my iPhone 4 and my iPad 2, and I play games on them all the time, but the iPhone screen is too small to let you forget you‚Äôre using a phone and the iPad is too big to fit naturally in your hands for long periods of time. There are very few pockets capable of holding an iPad, and they are both definitely more fragile than the Vita.I honestly felt like I had the same kind of immersive experience playing on the Vita that I‚Äôm used to having on the Xbox and PS3, only with the added benefits that only a handheld can provide like a touchscreen and gyroscopic movement. And I was able to play on this ‚Äúconsole‚Äù with my headphones on while my kids watched a program on the main family TV, something I‚Äôm not able to do with the actual consoles. And fellow parents will understand how nice it was to be able to play a game rated ‚ÄúMature‚Äù while my kids were in the house and awake, without having to worry they‚Äôd see or hear something I‚Äôd rather they didn‚Äôt.Having a graphics comparison between the Vita and Nintendo 3DS is like having a comparison between a Playstation 3 and a Nintendo 64PS Vita is the way to goRead full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Amazingly great price!,"I bought this psvita since it was a really good price but I was skeptical at first. It did not come in it's original packaging, in fact it arrived in an amazon box; however, it was well packaged so no damages were done to the actually product. And the psvita (although not in its original packaging) looked practically new and functioned amazingly! This psvita is the older model which I absolutely adore. I find the heavier weight and nice metal finish adds character to the design. I am not the biggest fan of the newer model because it is plastic and looks cheap. So I am very happy with this purchase here and I highly recommend them if you plan to buy a psvita or anything else for that matter.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,The most powerful handheld gaming system on this planet!!!,"Let me start off this lengthy (but comprehensive) review by saying that at first, I was not completely sold with the Vita.But then I had to give in because casual games on my smartphone gets really boring, really fast. So, there I am off to buy the Vita. I must say that overall, I am really impressed by Sony's latest handheld gaming system. Let me break it down for you in different categories:EXTERIOR / OVERALL DESIGN:The moment I opened the box and took out the Vita, I really felt like I was holding a sophisticated piece of hardware. The smooth lines, paneling, the redisigned buttons, it was just like a chunk off of The Enterprise's console or something Darth Vader fiddled with during his ho-hum time inside the Death Star. If the iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy had a kid, the Vita would be it. Will be better appreciated if held in your hands instead of just looking at photos. It's just glossy all over. 9.5/10GRAPHICS/GAMEPLAYI don't know how they did it but somehow they were able to shrink the PS3. No other handheld can even come close. Looking at the games is just breathtaking. Once you start playing, it's really hard to imagine that it's a handheld, at times you'll even forget that you're not in front of your TV anymore. The *ehem* QUAD CORE PROCESSOR FOR THIS BABY REALLY KICKS YOU KNOW WHAT. The OLED 5 inch display is just gorgeous, you'll know right away that it was made for gaming.Seamless connectivity to your PS3 if you are playing a PS3-Vita cross platform game! And most Vita games have online multiplayer options! The buttons were redisgned from the original PSP look but I must say it still works, if not better. It's also  good that they made it a dual analog stick system. It just completed everything. The front touchscreen is very responsive, you won't be tapping hard on this baby to get it to do what you want to do. The only negative thing I can say is for some games, like Assassin's Creed, you'll notice some lag or delays when jumping off rooftops, not saying it's a bad thing because it is a beautiful game but if you're nitpicky, you'll surely notice it. The game cards or downloaded games will not work if you don't have a memory card inserted so that's a bummer. I recommend buying the 32GB right away because you'll eventually end up buying one anyway.Also the back touchscreen isn't really that responsive, especially if you exited out of the game temporarily and came back again, sometimes, it won't respond so you need to exit the game and then relaunch it. But it's a nice touch (excuse the pun) because it adds a whole new dimension to the gameplay. 9/10GAME CHOICES/GAME AVAILABILITYNow the good thing here is Vita's backwards compatability. The Playstation Store has everything! Games from PSX,PS ONE,PS2,PSP all available for download (for a certain amount) for your gaming pleasure. All the games prior to the Vita has been remastered for that PS VITA HD experience. Some games even added touchscreen controls!! The only negative part here is the actual Vita game library is not yet that big. I think developers should give the Vita more credit (2K Sports I'm talking to you! releasing NBA2K13 for PSP and nothing for the Vita!!!) and develop more games. I think it's still too early but right now I am really hopeful that a lot of good titles will be churned out for the Vita soon. 8.5/10 (for the meantime based on current game library)Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,"Great device, but no games!","The Ps vita is a great little handheld game system. It does everything you want it to do browse the internet, connect with friends, and most importantly play games. However that's where it begins to fall short in that even though it is a great system it lacks a good library of games. That's not to say you won't find something you'll like, its just that its very limited on the games it has. I recommend buying the system here on ebay for less than retail value to make it feel worth it, trust me buying it at retail price is a bad idea. You'll have spent all that money and have a small game library to show for it.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,"great value for the price. good functions, volume and battery life","i have a PS3 and an old PSP 1000. the graphics on the Vita are great, great sound and good battery life.... there are not that many games that i found interesting but that is just my preferences.<br>the price could be lower, but it still reasonable.The only things that i really did not like are:The fact that for transferring even a small image into a vita, you need both the content manager installed on your PC AND a ACTIVE internet connection. even with the PS3 you need to be logged in to the PlayStation Network..and then you have the Hyper-overpriced memory cards, yeah they are a Proprietary format....but they could have just used a simple micro-SD card with a special format much like the PS3's hard drive,even if you plug it in a PC it just won't be able to access the file in it, an d for the speed problem just say use class 4 or higher, which the the Vita's card work at about a micro-SD class 4 speed.. which costs about $20 for 32GB... far less that $100 they priced their cards.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Perfection of a handheld!,"This is the best handheld console out there. If you have any interest buying this, PLEASE I urge you to do so. This is the only system I use for gaming, and it is well worth it. The games for it are good, and with #1 titles just around the corner, NOW is the time to buy this console.As regards to dislikes, personally I would bring up 3G. It's almost useless for gaming. It can only be used for ""near"", or just signing into your account just to see what's going on. It's not reliable for much else, sadly. Also, $30 dollars per month is a bit expensive for most, so take that into consideration. (NOTE: This is my personal opinion on the 3G, man others may have enjoyed it, just not me)The only competitor to this is the 3DS, which I believe is left in the dust by this piece of heaven. There is a QUAD core processor in the Vita. That's right. 4 processors. That's better than the ipad 2. The screen is a 5in"" OLED touch screen with a rear touch panel to interact with games. Its HD screen looks marvelous. Watching a video on youtube does not justify the excellence of the screen. You can just look at comparison videos of the 2 consoles for yourself to see.All in all, This console deserves a 9.5/10. Almost perfect, but then again, nothing is perfect, but this is as close as you'll get to perfection. :)Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,great item,for been used its in great condition no scratch or anything only wish they would sell the memory card for the vista but other than that its great,5
Video Game Consoles,Love it!!!,"Very impressed with the product. It's a fun little gadget to have (if you got the right games of course).Thank you for speedy & hassle-free delivery. That always goes an extra mile with the customers.I would recommend this PSVITA to anyone who loves gaming. The hind/back touch pad is pretty cool too. The graphics are awesome. The camera, even though good, not really top of the range. But who buys this for the main purpose of shooting photos right!It's tha business! Nuf said!Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,"If you have a modern PS console, it is really great. If not, still great!","If you have a PlayStation Plus membership, this is a great addition. If you don't know about it, free games with the subscription. If you have a PS3 it can remote play and link to it. Same with the PS4, which can do even more with it. The game selection has been built up reasonably well. Games like Killzone and Uncharted look really good. Features are pretty good, but if you have a decent smartphone, this really only functions as a gaming device, but that is what it is truly meant for anyway. The OLED screens of the original system looks amazing, but can use a little battery at times. Touch screen and rear touch panel integration in games is pretty good. Depends on the game, but it can certainly add a lot of function. And finally a handheld device featuring two analog sticks. Makes FPS games exponentially better.The only real detraction is the memory card system. Sony's proprietary system is quite pricey. They did it to counteract hacking the system with standard cards, so to an extent I can sympathize, but still a bit frustrating. A large memory card is a must if you have digital copies of a few games, especially if you subscribe to PS+...So plan accordingly.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,"The best handheld console out there, great for every gamer.","THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE VITA SLIM, JAPANESE IMPORT.I had been thinking about upgrading from my old PlayStation Portable (the fat 1004 model), and started looking at the 3DS. The 3DS has region locks, meaning that an imported unit from Japan can only play Japanese games. But seeing as the old model was still a bit pricy, and that there are no new games except for the same old Mario, Pokemon, and Zelda ""upgrades"", I was doubtful of buying one.That's when I found out there was a new Vita model, the PCH-2000, or Slim.It has improved buttons, where the old Vita had elliptic, flush Start, Select, and Home buttons, the new Vita has convex buttons, that are easy and comfortable to press.It has 1 GB of onboard storage, which means you won't have to pay for a memory stick (they are a bit pricy). Just buy the game in a store, pop it in, and start playing. However, you can't combine the onboard storage with a memory stick. Once you insert a memory stick, the built-in storage is disabled, and you get the option to transfer the files from the onboard storage, onto the memory stick.It's been slimmed down, and is lighter, than the previous model, significantly improving the ergonomics.The screen however, has been swapped out. The gorgeous OLED display has been replaced by an LCD screen, but not a bad one. Not at all. This might just be the sharpest LCD screen I have ever seen. It doesn't display colours as well as the OLED, but this is something you wouldn't notice unless comparing the two models directly. But since the new model has an LCD display, it's also more energy efficient. I usually get 8 hours of heavy gameplay, on full brightness, and 2 of those hours are online gaming, on a single charge.The game selection is great, with games across the board to keep any gamer satisfied. There are even more great titles coming later this year!The Vita's UI is as snappy as ever, handling any task you throw at it lightning fast. It also incorporates some serious multitasking. You can be in the middle of that last boss fight when you receive a message, so you pause the game, open the notification bubble, open the message, read it and reply to it, and then return to the game, keep fighting the same boss, and take a screenshot of your victory to brag to your friends through a group chat.This, in my opinion, is the ultimate handheld. Great games, great features, and a great entry price.Pros:-Great price for such a capable machine.-Increased battery life.-More ergonomic design and buttons.-Good game selection.-No region locks.Cons:-Screen a downgrade from the old Vita.-Speakers' sound is a bit tinny.-Onboard storage disabled when a memory stick is inserted.-The back likes to attract fingerprints.If you're looking for a handheld console, and can't make your mind up, I'd advice you to get a PlayStation Vita Slim. If you want one that really pops, import a colourful one from Japan!Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,I love the Sony PlayStation Vita so much that i decide to buy two of them!,"This thing should come with warning. Why? because there some things that are very important when first buying this machine.1. REGION: Choose your region wisely,Go with US if you want the fastest new release of games and many free demo.The PSN prepaid card available widely in US currency.US region have wide variety of fav and memorable PSP games that you can download and play on your Vita.Go with Asia region if you want to buy games that are only available released on Japan. Most of them are in Japanese of course.Go with Malaysia region if you want to buy vita games with price drops. there are 2,3 good games price drops near 50%. Such as Wipeout and Modnation Racer.2. MEMORY CARD: Take my advice, buy 32GB of Vita Memory card because you willl need it. Sooner or later. I personally dislike changing game card everytime i want to switch and play other game, so get a big memory card, download them on PS store. Or be wise, if a game size if more than 3GB for for example Mortal Combat and Blazblue, Buy the game card.3. PSN STORE: Becarefull when using your credit card, i had trouble with adding funds to PSN store wallet and it is a common problem. I had no problems before but after two three days, it seems i cant no longer able to use my credit card there. Maybe their security is very thight. Alternatively, go for PSN prepaid card. Its much safer.4. GAMES: Games are extremely expensive. There are no signs of 'Hacked' Vita games to date. So be wise when buying, read reviews, comments and youtube gameplay on that spesific game. Then when u think its worth it, then buy it. Otherwise if available, just download the playable demos for free.5. 3G and WIFI: AT&T 3G version of the Vita is LOCKED! i repeat LOCKED to its own network. that means it wont be usable outside US or other mobile network on US. Go for UK or ASIA/Hong Kong Version of the Vita if you are planning to use 3G.Well, the reason that i know a few thing about the Vita is i own two of them. 1 on Malaysia Region that i bought on Sony Style, and 2 on US Region that i bought used and very cheap on eBay.Until next review.Ciao.Read full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,Great add on for all Playstation fans..,"A powerful little machine. Good game library, great graphics. It's the little features that do this justice.",5
Video Game Consoles,"Fragile analog sticks, but solid device slim 2000 ver import","this is for version 2000 vita , jap import, khaki.gamed for seven months on it, now the right analog stick triggers on its own, with no touching downwards.there is no wireless controller for the vita, so i cannot fix this. either buy a new vita or ps3, frankly ps3 is a better deal.. not portable but do you game on the go much?overall vita is a great gadget with newest ver giving a solid 5hrs of play... wi fi is rather bad, spotty reception.in fact my fave thing about it is it plays videos just like a tablet, but has much better colors, even if the screen should have been brighter.2yrs i would expect from it, but 7 months is not enough of a lifetime, for the price, plus consider 64 gb card is quite pricey too.Read full review...",2
Video Game Consoles,My perfect buy,"It works and I dont see a problem and it has minor damages that can be easily repaired becaused of its used condition, but overall for me its a perfect console to use with the ps4 remote control.",5

Video Game Consoles,Great value!,I received my psvita in great condition with reasonable shipping time for the price. There was a slight scratch on the back (which is now covered by a case so I don't even notice it) and a very small screen defect (small bubble in the glass but not noticeable at all unless you are searching for it). The vita works perfectly and at $77 US it is the best purchase I have ever made. Thank you so much!!!Read full review...,5
Video Game Consoles,Excellent Condition for price!,i bought a grade c ps vita and i bought my first own used with a lot of ware on it so i assumed it would look like my previous one but wow. AND it had Henkaku installed! definitely worth the 180,5
Video Game Consoles,Fun Portable System! BETTER THAN THE 3DS!,"This system is a GREAT system. I did get the 3DS when it came out but this made the 3DS look bad. The graphics are ALOT better and the layout of the system is really good too. Their are fun games to play on it and the controls are pretty easy to get use to. The only problem that it does scratch VERY easily and I would recommend getting a case/and or screen protectors. I like the idea of getting trophys because it adds a little more fun of trying to get them like Acheivements on Xbox 360. This is my first Playstation product I have bought and I am very impressed. It is easy to use. the games are great, and the cost is a little high but it is a good value for the money. Get this system. It is VERY fun.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,"Although game library is small, the hardware is amazing and better than 3DS","I am truly amazed by the graphics on this handheld. It TRULY is like a console. If graphics are important to you, read no more and get the Vita! For those who still aren't sure, keep reading. In this review, I am going to try to not be biased. Even though I love my Vita, there is still some things I don't like.PROS: Amazing graphics, two analog sticks, two touchscreens, two camera, nice user interface, quad-core CPUCONS: Screen smudges easily, expensive, game library is very small, short battery lifeIf you want a portable gaming device, you have two options. The Vita or 3DS. The 3D feature on the 3DS is cool, but not very practical for gaming in my experience and appeals more to a younger audience. If you are older and want a more graphic intensive gaming experience, it is hard to not reccomend the Vita. It truly feels like playing a mini PS3 or xBox 360.While playing the Vita, there was a few things I disliked about it. First, the battery life lasted only about 3-4 hours playing games and surfing the web. Second, it is very bulky and difficult to fit into even a large pocket. Lastly, the game library is limited severely. There is only some 60 games on the market currently.Would I reccomend this to a friend? Yes!! This is the best portable gaming device money can buy. It is fast, has killer hardware, and plays game with PS3-like graphics. Don't wait any longer... Get it now! :)Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Greatest handheld console ever!,"Very underrated gaming machine.

Both my favorite handheld consoles.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Great handheld system,"The PS Vita is a great system. It was a little better when I got free vita games from my PS+ subscription. It is still a fun option to have.

Video Game Consoles,Cool deal.,For what this is its a good deal plus the only I have find is the outer frame is make and cut up a little in a few place that it. That is point out in the in the description. And if it really bugs you can spend a little bit of money and get a frame that's not messed up and swept all the parts. This is an awesome deal and should jump on if you can.the vita will not be this cheap forever or have a OLED screen in it.Read full review...,5

Video Game Consoles,The bottom line is if your on the go and like video games then go ahead A++,ok here i go! listen up im going to tell you straight up about this game system this PSV is the top of the line (RIGHT NOW) and it is a wonderful machine 5inch screen touch screen and ect. but i have no doubt that they will come with a SLIM PSV sooo whats the whole point right? i do give it up to the apps the PSN (playstation network) has to offer like youtube netflix facebook cameras (2)front and back set your wallpaper at the dashboard liltle things like that is what makes it special i like this system but im not totally inlove i like the graphics but it could of been a liltle more cheeper what i think it is 4/5 so that it is a liltle pricey but its ok i believe it could have been lot better and the system can easily get smudges everywhere not just the screen but the entire system back and front so i recommend screen protection as well hope this comes in handy to you all thanks for reading :)Read full review...,5
Video Game Consoles,As the cosmic power in a itty bitty living space,"I bought the Sony Playstation Vita to have a access to J-RPGS released only to Sony. The Model PCH-1001 is the wi-Fi version of this system. The OLED screen makes this handheld have the best visuals. The current ""slim"" version of this system doesn't have the quality of visuals the first edition has. The addition of getting a Players Plus Membership, you get 2 free games a month! Dragon's Crown was last months freebie! I haven't been disappointed too much.The only thing I have to say about this system is that it is difficult to play a FPS.

I chose this console to remind myself of the good times I've had in the past and the good times I'll make in the future.

This camera takes very blurry photos. I hoped it was just the screen, but the photos are just as blurry after being printed.

Headphones,Sony Headphones,"So I use these headphones during my weight lifting routine witch usually lasts for a few hours. I've been using them every day actually. The battery life is great, it has never run out and I just plug them in when I'm done with them. I'm sure they could last a while. They are super comfortable and made pretty durable. Bluetooth call quality is awesome, so the microphone works great. I think these headphones were a great deal.

Headphones,MDR-V600 - Simply Legendary,"I have been in the recording industry for over 25 years. I still have and use a set of these headphones bought around 23 years ago! I now have 8 pairs.I use them, exclusively for the artists who come into my recording studio and use them as my ""C"" speakers for final mastering ""tweaks.""In my opinion, these headphones are matched by no other headphone for comfort, clarity and responsiveness. Yes, there are more expensive sets out there...don't think that spending more will necessarily get you more!Key aspects that I feel make them excellent:1) Clarity of highs. Not piercing and provide smooth imaging.2) Solid but not artificially-enhanced bass response. These headphones replicate the bass response I, as an engineer/producer, intended.3) Comfort. These fit like a glove to the ear. Yes, they are a bit bulky on the head (not heavy-just bulky) but the ears are most important. I can comfortably use these for hours.4) Repair parts are out there. The only item that wears is the ear foam. Replacements are easily found on eBay. That's why I've had the first pair for 23 years! You cannot tell they're older than the new ones (on looks).5) Fast yet stable break-in time. These break-in within about 150 hours of use. Once that time is reached, they remain stable in clarity and response.6) HUGE: 1/8"" to 1/4"" adapter SCREWS on! That means, it STAYS on when moving around. Other adapters will easily pull out, screwing up a good take in the studio!Read full review...",5
Headphones,Excellent quality on a budget,These headphones are great.   The sound quality is phenomenal.   The large foam completely covers your ear blocking outside noise.   One or both ears can be turned out so you can hear outside noise if you want.   the long cord is beneficial and the gold plated connectors ensure a good quality sound.My only complaint is the curly cue cable.   I can never keep the coils tight and the cables end up looking ratty.   A small complaint.Read full review...,5
Headphones,Sony MDR-600 Professional Headphones,"This is the 2nd pair of these head phones I have owned. The fist pair is about 15 years old.  It says somthing today about a electronic product that has beeen around that long and not changed.  It was built right the first time.  These phones are comfortable to wear and have excellent sound, better than ear bud type speakers. Only one warning, do not leave then in a hot car the covering on the ear muffs will stick together.  But you can order replacement ear pads.Read full review...",5
Headphones,Gorious sound plus rugged construction,"I bought my first MDR-V600 in (?)1995 when Consumer Reports rated the unit at the top.  The price was then $100.  Now it appears to have tripled to $300, but the 600 is still available.  I agree with other reviews: top sound.  In fact I've been spoiled.  Another feature is the length and thickness of the cord.  I am seeking another, a third unit, on ebay.  Number two has a cracked, broken off head piece, frazzled ear pieces, and a worn cord.  Though most of the wire covering is gone, the head phones continue to work gloriously, but one can expect only so much endurance from bare wire!  The left ear phone now cuts into my temple, but the sound remains glorious.Read full review...",5
Headphones,Made to last forever.,"I bought my first set of MDR-V600 back in 2002.  Well. they are still pumping great sound.  I bought these fixer uppers for my kids.  Sound is still great.  Spent another 15 buck for cushions,and other comforting parts, but well worth it.  These headphones will last a lifetime,and if something goes wrong, there is always parts available.  Nonetheless, I have ever had to replace the sound components, only the cushions.  They do not make these like they used to.Read full review...",5
Headphones,Hope they last a while.,"These were very low priced. They were very easy to put on, but take your time and ease them into the slots. if they last a year or two, I guess that's good.",4
Headphones,The value for these headphones was amazing !!!,I purchased these for my adult son for Christmas. This set of 4 headphones was all he wanted. He loves the sound quality of them and was very excited to get 4 pair for less than the price of one pair new. Thank you for giving both of us a great Christmas. Now he has 3 backup pair for forever.Read full review...,5
Headphones,SONG MDR-V600 ,The sound quality in these are AMAZING!! Trust me. I've had mine since the early 2000's (2003) and they STILL sound AMAZING!! I love them so much I bought another pair in 2019.  But my old pairSTILL SOUND AMAZING!! Read full review...,5
Headphones,Buy 'em. These will be the last pair of phones you will ever buy.,"I have been a radio DJ for over 25 years. The broadcast studio is a rough place for headphones. They get knocked off the counter, thrown against the walls, ""borrowed"" by other employees. Headphones generally have a very short life in a radio station. After going through several other pairs of headphones, I got these. I used the first pair daily for over 10 years before they went missing. The second pair gave me the same results. I also ended up with a third pair. I stopped using them when the ear pads got all nasty from the vinyl coverings dry-rotting. Last year, I found some aftermarket replacement pads on ebay for only a few dollars. They are like new again and still work like new even though they have been heavily abused. Sound quality is incredible with crisp highs and smooth ultra low bass. I have had the opportunity to use headphones that cost well over $1,000.00, but I would rather have my good 'ol Sony MDR-V600s hands down!Read full review...",5
Headphones,110 %  Very good !!!  Thank You !!!,"Better than the ones I got now !!! The old pair I purchased in 1995 we're getting a little old and were beginning to lose some sound quality. I specifically wanted these because of the very wide frequency response range. 10,000- 30,000. Even the Sony Professional of the very near design are only 12,000-28,000 or 14,000-26,000, something like that. I would still like to reimburse you for shipment. Two days? Must have cost you $10-20 dollars. Treat me good, and I treat you good, and excellent write-up too.   Thanks Again !!!  Ken in Chicago.Read full review...",5
Headphones,Very Nice Headphones,"These headphones fit great around the ears. They are still comfortable even after long periods of use.   Minimal outside noise can be heard, and the the sound quality is excellent.  High and low ranges both have excellent quality.  I would recommend these headphones for someone starting out doing recording or producing that is looking for good quality at a reasonable price.Read full review...",5
Headphones,Competes with the best for a very competitive price.,"Comfortable, clarity, crisp high end, tight bottom end they last. Ear pads degrade but can be replaced for about $7 to $8. I know that many headphones fail at the point the the cord goes into the head set, so I have clipped my cord up so as to work as a strain relief.Read full review...",5
Headphones,Sony Phones Rock,great headphones at a great price... I have worked in recording studios and used the best known phones.  These are one of the best sets I have used on my home Computer and Stereo.,5

Headphones,Most sony products are of good quality.,Superb Product.,5
Headphones,The only headphones I've ever used....,"I started djing in 1998 and bought my first and only pair of Sony MDR-V600. Today is April 13th, 2011 and I have finally broken down and had to buy another pair of headphones.These headphones have been to hell and back, and they look like they have! Over the years I have used tape and screws to put them back together because the sound of these headphones have never failed me. They have been sat on and abused from all the clubs and rave parties over the years. They are falling apart but still have the best sound quality ever!It's great telling the story about my headphones lasting all these years when djing, but it's getting a little embarrassing now that I have tape holding my headphones together.I recommend the Sony MDR-V600's to everyone, they lasted 13 years for me!cheers,KellyRead full review...",5
Headphones,20 years strong!!!!!!!!!,"I bought these headphones in 1994, yes 1994. I will put their sound quality up against any beats out there. They are quite rugged. I'm military and have traveled around the world with them. They never let me down. The ear pad material started to wear, so I got some covers for them and they lasted this long. The other day my wife let our three year old son use them and somehow he broke one of the pins holding one sides on. I will never find another pair for $40.00!!! Yup I got them from a guy for 40 bucks. Even broke they still play!!! Best headphones!!!Read full review...",5

While they are a bit bulky for the ipod while walking, they work very well on the bus commute to work.Read full review...",4

Lenses,Great color and sharp,Having the lens for a few weeks now it meets all the expectation. Like everyone else I wish I bought it sooner. Not as big as some reviews say it is just not the case.After having the Sony 16-35 F4 for a few years I just never felt the need to upgrade the same focal length now I see it was worth itRead full review...,5
Lenses,"Outstanding Lens, a little pricey, but absolutely worth it!","This is by-far the best zoom lens built. It has a solid construction with, currently, the sharpest image quality for a zoom lens. It's a little more expensive than several other lens but you will not find a sharper image in a zoom. This lens ranks higher than several prime lens, check the DxO Mark rating for the lens and you will be convinced this is the lens to buy. The f-stop allows you to take photos with quicker shutter speed while maintaining a crisp picture. If you do not want to be stuck carrying several prime lens, maybe this is your alternative. I like the ability to find a great spot to shoot landscapes then fine tune the lens for the composition I want.Read full review...",5
Lenses,Better than expected,"Yes, it costs twice as much as it's f4 counterpart but I must admit they are worlds apart. Images are crisp corner to corner. Amazing in low light situations. If there was a bone to pick (and we're getting really nitty gritty here) within the range it would be at 35mm. That's the only time I felt was not as sharp as the rest. Overall though, my favorite lens to use within the Sony family.Read full review...",5

Digital Cameras,D500 Awesome Crop Camera.,"This is the first camera in the so called professional grade.  Was surprised it did not have at least 1 point and shoot mode.  Other than that, it is an awesome Camera.  I have taken nearly 3,000 pic already.  I use it with Telephoto lens to get wildlife and landscape.  I love the fact when it locks on to a target, I can get a total sequence of wing flapping.It took about 1,000 shot to figure out that I was better off in Manual mode and configure some of the button to quickly change focus mode to the environment I find myself in.I did not and do not have the issue of short battery life.  One day I too over 600 pics and the battery was still going strong.I love the fact that my 400mm is equivalent to a 600mm lens.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Not what I expected...,"I do bird and wildlife photography, mostly birds---ISO capability is important.  I've used Nikon D50, D200, D300s, and then waited for the Nikon D400, which never came.  I got the Nikon D7100 instead, begrudgingly settling for the non ""pro"" control settings.   I was pleasantly surprised, and then fell in love with the images I got with that camera.  ISO capability was a big jump up, sharp contrasty shots and great AF.  But a hard break stop in the car cracked the LCD screen, and I found my opportunity to get the D500.  I've used it for 2 weeks:  quiet, fast as heck, good af, all my old Nikon settings plus some, and good ISO.  But I'm not getting the sharp images I was with the D7100, or even my D300s.  Could well be something I'm missing, but given my experience at semi pro level photography, I don't think so.  Also battery life is not as good as either any of my old bodies.  I just ordered another D7100, which are super cheap...  I could see this being a great sports camera.Read full review...",3
Digital Cameras,Best Camera I Will Ever Afford.,"This camera is probably the best camera I'll ever own. There is a small learning curve, as with any new camera. Monochrome photos are actually monochrome NEF files with all the color data in them. (should you change your mind.) I still need to learn how to retain noise reduction in editing. Photos are monochrome on the display. (unless of course, you're shooting color). Noise reduction in camera is terrific. With only a little softening. The articulating screen is everything it should be. I'm just beginning to explore the wide range of settings on this camera. I do have to say, this D500 is in a whole other class from my old D3200.

Digital Cameras,"fast focus, great picture clarity, feel like a high end FX body except the weight","This DX body focus speed at least as fast as my D3s (if not better), low light focusing is surprisingly fast. Image quality is excellent, feel like a FX D3s in terms of picture clarity. Built quality is excellent, a lot of metal but not heavy!! LCD screen is very clear and beautiful, coming from a D300, it is day and night difference.Because of the light weight factor, I started collecting DX lens (though I already owns many FX lens), such a great ""little"" (comparing to D3s) body that I can really tour with it, beach walk is now doable with camera.I will strongly recommend this as the best backup body if you feel FX is too heavy. Also a great camera if you want to start fresh, the gap between FX and DX is narrowing down with this nice camera.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Very Happy with this Nikon D500 Camera Kit!!,- The kit as assembled by Cameta has everything needed to start taking photos immediately. The heavily padded knapsack easily houses everything and feels like it should last a good long time. It's adjustable and fairly comfortable to wear.- The Nikon D500,5
Digital Cameras,Best dang DX YET,IT does wat a D3 does when the D3 first came out. Except there is about a $3500 savings. Other than 95% view. Which is splitting hairs in my book. Plus it has the 1.3 additional crop factor which yields a 2. O crop. But. NO full frame. Which I don't use all that often anyway. Unless I am in a situation where I simply need the extra megapixels or extra wide that full frame yields one. The orginal zoom Feet.  I shoot weddings. Rodeo arena. Sports some commercial.. Vehicles for car dealers and just about anything else as long as it legal. 46 years behind a camera all with Nikon. Well Nikon and Mamiya roll film when it was popular. 35mm was all Nikon. Now all digital is Nikon. So yes 46 years with Nikon.22 years in The U S Air Force and guess what I did there. Photographer  Old is not for another 15-20 years. Keep Shooting. Reinvent yourself as needed. Keep buying NikonRead full review...,5
Digital Cameras,Better than I am,"This camera is fantastic and has left practically nothing out on features. I'm still learning the DSLR world after having much about SLRs in the pre-digital age decades ago. I chose this camera as it provides features that may only be pertinent to a pro, but as such it would have anything a new by would want. This it has and then some. I'm advancing in my training in how to merely use it, after which I will have years to learn how to get good with it.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Very satisfied with this purchase.,"Many reviews of the D500 are available on the Internet, and Tony Northrup's and Steve Perry's are a couple that were most helpful to me because of my interest in wildlife photography.  The pro's are many and the few con's are not issues for me.  I do wish the XQD memory cards were far more available at more reasonable prices.  If you're interested in purchasing one of these cameras and have not personally held and ""played"" with one, then that's a step you definitely need to do before committing to the expense of purchasing one.  It isn't a point-and-shoot for a totally inexperienced photographer; it will take time to learn, set, and use its many menu options.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Definitely a pro camera.,"I'm using this professionally at a small newspaper. It's a hit. Even at ASA 51,200, the pictures are sharp and saturation is just right. While the various autofocus modes take a little study, once they're mastered it's just stunning what they can do. And the camera is solid -- I have the sense that it don't have to go to the camera doctor, even under the rigors of all sorts of assignments.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Nikon d500 camera,The camera arrived early and was in a like new condition with all original items. I am new to the pro type of cameras but found it easy to set up and use. Focus and speed are great for wildlife and water fowl photographs. It's a great camera!Read full review...,5
Digital Cameras,"Great Features, Lots to Learn","As expected, this is an exceptional camera. My other primary body is a D7200, which I love. I bought the D500 for its enhanced AF capabilities, low light performance and fast fast action capture. I haven't been disappointed.I will say there's a lot to learn here for an intermediate-trying-to-be-advanced amateur, but that's always the case with a new body.I hesitated over the ""good value"" question. Given it's new in 2016 and the feature set, it's predictable that the price is high. I'd say it's a ""comparable value"" in a market that puts a premium on the latest model.I'm also not 100% sold on the mixed memory card arrangement. XQD cards are expensive and I find it less complicated to have two SD slots in the D7200. However, I may learn to appreciate the added speed and capacity of the XQD.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,The title was very complete which is why I took a 2nd and 3 rd look when deciding which of the many Nikon D500 before buying.,I owned an early Nikon DSLR.

Digital Cameras,Best DX DSLR,"I have owned a Nikon d7100 for the last 4 years and I can definitely say this is a big upgrade.

I can‚Äôt wait to go and use this camera moreRead full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Mini D5,"Finally we have a legit mirrorless fighter and DX format to rival FX. If money is an issue, go all DX lenses and never look back but for working pros this is a nice 3rd or 4th body for sports remotes. If you're still loving your 70-200 VR II, this paired, corrects the focal length becoming truer since it was more of a 60-180ish to begin with. To give you where it falls overall score-wise is that it's better than a D3s and D4 but won't outshine a D4s. Note: get it with a grip, batteries inly last a 1,000+ shots with just the body alone.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Perfect for wildlife/sports photography,"The Nikon D500 is superb for taking photos of wildlife and sports. Even portrait shots turn out great.

But for photographers looking to up their game, the D500 is exactly what they need.Read full review...",5

Digital Cameras,Great Camera Body,The camera is good but the batteries and grip leave a lot to be desired. I found out later that the D500 specifically had issues with 3rd party grips and batteries.

Digital Cameras,The best camera I've ever used,"The Nikon 500d just feels great in my hands and when I dial in my settings and put it on auto ISO it just works. I grabbed a cheap speed Flash and stuck it on there and just aimed into a darkened room and took a shot and it came out perfect. 1/64 manual flash with no adjusting before the shot. You can watch the reviews on YouTube. I have a Sony A7 III and a Canon 7D Mark II. I'll be selling the cannon and keeping the Sony a7iii with a Tamron 28 to 75 4 walk around and Street, the incredible Nikon d500 will be my wildlife and macro camera and possibly take over everything else. If there is a negative I suppose it is bigger and bulkier than the Sony but it feels wonderful and it's built like a tank. No complaints. I set my settings and it gets out of the way and I take pictures.Read full review...",5

Digital Cameras,Nikon D500 upgrade,"I came from a Nikon d5300, right off the bat I noticed the difference in frames per second.  Get yourself an XQD card to minimize bottlenecks.  It will take some time to get used to since some of the buttons have been moved around but that isn't so much of a big deal since you can customize it.  So far worth the price of admission.Read full review...",5

Digital Cameras,Fantastic camera. But it was a gray model.,"This camera is good for pro-sumer photographers. Everything is very good so far. Just problem is I bought a gray model which was slightly cheaper without any warranty or user‚Äôs manual. Nobody will repair the camera in future.

Digital Cameras,One of the best Ebay cameras,"Sony really does make great products, and the Mavica FD85 is one of them. I bought a used FD85 a few years ago for taking pictures of items for my Ebay listings. Over the years I've become a real fan. The camera takes fantastic pictures, and has a great macro mode for taking detailed close ups. There are all the usual options like sepia, black and white, solarize and so forth. Picture size is easily adjusted, and can be downsized easily to Ebay friendly sizes. There is also an MPEG movie capture feature.The FD85 can be fitted with threaded filters, lenses like any good 35mm film camera. For me though, the most usefull feature is the floppy disk. With the floppy you can take a picture (from 9 to 40 depending on the size). Edit that picture and store it on the disk. Then you can stick that disk in any computer with a 3.5 floppy drive and see the pictures without drivers, or cables. Amazing! Plus other people are shocked you can use floppies in a digital camera, it's eccentric and strange.Mavica FD series cameras are real cameras in a point and shoot world. They don't come in super high mega pixels. They aren't sleek and stylish like the current crop of digital cameras, but you would be hard pressed to find a better quality camera for the same buck.I love it!Read full review...",4
Digital Cameras,"Great Digital camera, a bit outdated.","This is an excellent digital camera and very easy to use. It's got a big screen, and a user friendly menu. It is a bit outdated, and uses floppy disks, which unfortunately, most computers don't even come with floppy disk drives anymore. If you have a drive, this is a fantastic camera. The newer cameras with the tiny SD cards, are smaller and each SD card holds many more pictures than a floppy - but if you are working on an older computer, with a floppy drive this might be the perfect choice.Read full review...",4
Digital Cameras,Old school floppy disks work for me on E Bay,"I have worn out 5 of these old Sony Mavica cameras.  I like the floppy when doing E Bay.  It is just my way and is easy for me.  My son uses a more up to date camera and uses a picture file and loves that method, so there is know right or wrong way.  This type camera listed for about $750 a few years ago and now you can find them for less than $100 on E Bay.  Pay attention to the condition and find out who used it and doing what?  I noticed them using this type camera on CSI the other night on TV.  Easy to keep that disk and label it. Got a $1000 vase to pack?  Photo sequence your packing and hold onto the disk until the vase arrives safely.  Shippers may need a little convincing about your packing method if you turn in a claim.  Close up on this camera is very sharp and you can get really close.  This is so important.  Get rid of the strap and lens cover...always getting into the picture due to gravity. I wrote the young man who sold me this camera and thanked him for taking such good care of the camera and sending me the manual, box, cord, extra disks, etc. really a clean like new camera.  I love it.  I have had these go dead on me and I have to use my other digital camera and a card reader.  It works fine but I keep a Mavica back up or 2.  Great for me.  I buy most everything off E Bay.  By far the most economical way to shop.   fmRead full review...",5

The Camera has it own charger all you have to do is connect the cord and plug it into the electric, depending on your battery how long it takes to charge,  the batteries are rechargeable and last several photo taking successions, you are not constantly changing batteries,  and they take real nice pictures..up to 8x10...I have even make posters out of my grandson's photos...I love photos they are long term memory for me...Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Sony Mavaca,"The Sony Mavica is probably one of the best products Sony has made.  Use of the 3.5"" floppy for a disc is great, handy and easily accessible.   Only problem is if used does not have access to a disc capable of using 3.5 floppy.   Viewing area can get scratched, but this one is in near perfect condition.   Battery charges to more than 200 minutes.  Can't believe anyone would need more.   Operator can select resolution, and altough camera is rated at just 1.3 megapixel, the photos have excellent resolution.

Digital Cameras,Sony Mavica MVC FD85 1.3 Megapixel I love it Greatly!,"I am a previous buyer/owner of a Sony Mavica MVC FD75 which was bought through eBay  in 2001.  I love it and wanted another one as a backup because I use mine all the time and so does my family.  So buying this Sony Mavica MVC FD85 1.3 Megapixel worked out very well for me.  I went searching for another Mavica MVC FD75 and found this one at a awesome price, so It became mine.  The main difference between the two is the Mavica MVC FD75 is a 10X Zoom and takes awesome still pictures only.  My new Sony Mavica MVC FD85 1.3 Megapixel only has 4X Zoom but it also has Video and Voice with it so the Zoom reduction is the only dislike that I have for it.  I am use to my 10X zoom but I love it no matter.  I highly recommend it to any one.  The film is 3 1/2 inch .44MG Disc's so nice for holding my pictures onto.  I like it better than the little memory cards I see on cameras now.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,I love this camera.,"I love the Mavica FD-85, because it was my first. I bought it for  Floppy discs/ Floppy disc adapter  with memory stick feature. It might be slower for transferring jpeg or mpeg files to one's PC or Mac than the newer digital cameras featuring USB or fire wire, but it's still fine. I loved being able to shoot pictures in NYC in Washington Square park for the last 5 years ago and selling the pics on floppy disc to peoplel who wanted their picture taken. My relatives loved when I gave them the pictures right away without cables.(When I first bought it some people didn't have USB)Of course sending your photos via  email is the most convenient way to do it these days with every one having DSL and high speed Cable internet service. The bottom line is, this camera takes a outstandly sharp pictures.Read full review...",5

I found the movie portion was a little over rated. Mine is not retired yet I will be continue with it until it dies. Currently I own a Nikon D80 I love it as well. Although I paid 3 time more than my MVC-FD85. My Sony will always have a space in my heart, it is tried and true. Yes it's no DSLR there are many time I see that I can continue using it.Floppy for me is still a cheap media. Three years ago I ordered that feature on my computer I am glad I did.There is more to this camera I haven t even mentioned.Yes it does not have a 10 megapixel only 1.3For me it will continue in my arsenal til it works no more.Great CCD Camera.Read full review...",5

Digital Cameras,Sony Cyber-shot,"I have three or four cameras. Three are profesional SLR type. They look like the 35 mm cameras. I had a small camera something like this one. I loaned it to a frieng for his trip to Hawaii. He got soaked in a wave of water and soaked the camera. It no longer works. I use the smaller camera when I ride my motorcycle. It fits in my pocket. The main thing I would do differently would be to get a camera that uses standard AA batteries like the old one. Other than that, the camera works great, tales good pictures. Over all I am happy with the buy. One good thing is I think I paid around $50.00. That is very reasonable for a camera of this type. New they are going for about $ 145.00.Read full review...",4
Digital Cameras,Sony Cyber-shot DSC-S750 Camera,"I tried out a few different digital cameras before going with the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-S750 7.2 Megapixel camera. This unit should be all the camera that a normal person would ever need. It has the option of setting all of the settings yourself, for those times when you are trying to produce a certain effect. It also has some of the most advanced point and shoot options that I have seen in any other digital point and shoot camera. So it doesn't matter if you want to be in total control, or if you don't want to be bothered with all of that and just pay attention to the fun at hand. The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-S750 7.2 Megapixel Megapixel camera should be plenty of camera for you.The only thing that some usres might like, or need would be higher megapixel resoulation. If that is the case there is a Sony Cyber-shot for every pocket book. If you've got the money, they've got the megapixels.Read full review...",4
Digital Cameras,awsome camera,"this camera is great for the price it can take a picture in any light and quality most of the time is just awesome and well detailed...u have to experiment with it to get those perfect pics just like any other new device it has to be set accordingly, this is a very nice camera to start out with until you can afford one of the newer models..the only thing i don't like about this camera is the lack of options u basically cant edit the picture in any way and also u aren't given the option whether to save the image or delete it right after its taken...but overall its a nice compact little camera worth every cent i just hope mine lasts long enough until i can afford newer modelRead full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Digital marvel,I bought a cybershot digital camera 7.1 mp a week ago and found that it was working perfect and in top condition. the camera has a 3.mm zoom that is easy to operate with a touch of a zoom in and out button. the wide 2.5 view screen in just right for people who have eye problems. the rest of the features in easy handling since it is all in one dial. I recommend this camera since it can be used by anyone.Read full review...,5
Digital Cameras,Great Little Camera,"This camera is very easy to use and takes nice pictures.  It was recommended by a professional photographer as a good camera for personal use. I got it the day before my daughter's wedding and was able to learn enough in a very short time to get some nice pictures with it.  The smile detection for children takes some getting used to, but it is a nice, helpful feature.  I still have more to learn, but I'm very happy with the camera.Read full review...",5

Digital Cameras,Sony Cyber Shot,"I bought this item because I needed a digital camera for my trip. I decided to buy it because it was so much cheaper to buy it here then it was in the store. This is a pretty good camera. The only thing I dislike about it is that there isnt very much storage on the camera, you have to purchase an additional Mass Storage card. Also, if you zoom in all the way, the picture turns out blurry, but other than that it is a pretty good camera.Read full review...",4

Digital Cameras,Sony Cybershot DSC-S750,"This is a very average camera, good for taking pictures on the go or whenever you just happen to want to capture a particular moment. It's very decent, not the best camera out there but also not the worst. I use this camera for shooting scenery and people until I am able to afford the DSLR of my dreams. This is a very good camera if you want to start going into photography, are interested in photography, or just use photography as a hobby. I personally was gonna get a better model but I just bought this to save money. It's an okay camera. I would recommend it only if you want to take regular pictures meaning it won't give you the best quality but it'll do and at 7.2 megapixels it is pretty good for a very cheap camera. So I would say this camera is a fairy decent buy.Read full review...",3

It has a 1M-pixel camera, video camera, and speakerphone. The NewPhone's size is perfect for carrying in a pocket and the battery has a pretty good lifespan of roughly 4 hours. My only complaint is that the menu system on the phone makes you click four times before you can find someone in the address book, set an alarm, or perform a additional functions. Other phones I've owned have simpler menus and get you to important features easily. Overall, I'd recommend the phone if you're on a budget.Read full review...",5

Digital Cameras,perfect camera for Ebay selling,"Since I been selling on Ebay, 8 years plus, this has been my camera to use. I had one where you had to use a USB port, after awhile the connection part on the camera broke. That camera was more expensive than this one is. This is the best way to do alot of ebay selling. You never have to hook up to the computer, you simply take your pictures, they are on a disk and you can download at your leisure. The camera has a feature where you can look at the picture, and delete it from the camera or keep it on the disk and delete it from the computer after you download them.What I don't like about this camera, and No fault of the camera, is that if you drop this, and mess it up :) it will cost more to fix than the camera is worth. So at my house this is handled like a baby.On this camera I have two batteries, one battery last only for 20 pictures and then the life of the battery is over, It's not the camera but the battery, but you need the battery for the camera to work. Do make sure you get a  charger. The thing is the battery isn't easy to find. So if you buy this, attempt to make sure you have the charger and the battery. Cause the camera will last longer than the battery.This camera has a format so that you can clean the disk for the next use. And so that you are able to reuse the disk and use them over and over, so you get your money's worth on the use of this camera. Camera using disk are harder to find. So this antique of a camera is still worth it.I took this on a vacation to London and Use a disk for London one for Wales and so on and it was so easy to just save the disk of different places that way. weeks later after returning I could then download. If I had a memory card, they are more expensive to have. Disk are the cheapest form of holder for your pictures.Read full review...",4
Digital Cameras,Best camera I‚Äôve ever owned for candid active shots,I‚Äôve owned several cameras over the years. Although the megapixels are not very high there is one feature that can not be matched my any camera I‚Äôve ever owned. The instant you press the shutter button it takes the picture. I‚Äôve taken so many fantastic shots of the kids over the years using this camera because of that one feature. I also love the 10X true optical zoom. I can take great pictures from across the room. One more thing... the battery life is incredible. One charge lasts me pretty much all day. Read full review...,4
Digital Cameras,Sony Mavica Digital Camera MVC FD73,This is the perfect camera if you need an easy way to take pictures. This takes a floppy disc and then just plug the disc into your CPU. You can easily put pictures on auctions or emails. The camera is easy to use. You can zoom in and out. The battery charges easily and quickly. The camera notifies you of low battery life so you can work faster or stop and charge. Having a floppy disc of your pictures means you can easily take them to work or whatever. I am not a computer savy person but this camera has inabled me to list good auctions. I borrowed a camera like this from work before I purchased my own. I find this camera to be computer friendly and easy to use.Read full review...,4
Digital Cameras,"An oldie, but a goodie!!","It is reliable - had one for 7 years of constant service. It takes good photos with very small sizes: excellent compression algorithm: splendid for quick-loading web pages.  Very simple to use.  Fantastic for macro shots: has optical zoom, but it also has a very short minimum focal length: you can get right up against what you wish to shoot, and without using the zoom you can get resolutions down to 0.07mm, which is awesome for something not attached to a microscope!!! // On the downside, it's a bit ancient in digital technology, and most of them are getting a bit long in the tooth, with little quirks in battery usage and ""disc errors"" showing up every now and then, and it is not good for showing natural colors in the viewfinder, or for use in sunlight.Read full review...",4
Digital Cameras,Sony Mavica MVC FD73 0.35 Megapixel,This camera is clearly not the state of the art and the floppy disc is not as convenient as it may have been when virtually all computers had floppy drives.This camera has less than one megapixel of resolution but I still love it. The pictures that this camera takes look good in snapshot size.Why do I love this thing?  I think it is the ultimate internet camera. The pictures it takes have a small file size. This means no messing in Photoshop or some other program in order to e-mail or post pictures in forums.I think the lack of floppy drives on modern computers has driven the price of these cameras down to the point of being a steal.  USB floppy drives are readily available at good prices. With this camera it is minutes from snapping a picture to posting it and it is a no brainer!Did I mention that I love this thing?PhilRead full review...,4
Digital Cameras,"Good for eBay sellers, quite outdated otherwise!!!","This camera is great for eBay sellers who don't need high resolution pictures.  Obviously with only .35MP resolution, this camera won't be suitable for taking vacation pictures and such.  However, if you want the convenience of not needing any card readers or connection cords to be able to retrieve your pictures, this camera is for you.  You get your picture saved right to the floppy that you can insert into your PC and you are done.  Additional benefit is no need to spend extra money on more expensive media storage cards.  Floppies are pretty cheap nowadays.Overall, i would only recommend this camera for people who don't like to deal with extra gadgets.  Otherwise, there are cameras with much higher resolution available for about the same price.  With a simple card reader you can transfer pictures just as easily.  I really don't see any other advantages to this camera.You also need to be careful about upgrading to a brand new PC.  These days, some of them come without a floppy drive all together and that would present a problem.Read full review...",3
Digital Cameras,Sony Navica FD73 The Trojan Horse,"For a early version Mavica, this little Box looking camera is full of surprises inside. It is very easy to pick up and in a few minutes you will be snapping away. It does take desent photos, and takes very good close up photos for use on taking photos for you stuff you want to sale here on EBay.I dislike that it is hard to find extra lenses for this camera. If you can find them, they cost more than the camera is worth. Second thing , is that you can't charge the battery whlie in the camera. All in all it is not a bad camera for someone just starting out or to give to a younger kid to learn with. I hope this helps.Read full review...",4
Digital Cameras,Great camera for the price !!,"I have been using this camera for 13 years now. It was my first camera when I started selling on ebay back in 1999.  I originally paid $500. Today, you can pick them up for a steal (under $50 on ebay). It is super easy to use and understand. It takes awesome close-up pictures !!!  The picture quality only gets a little dicey when you are shooting larger images from a distance. Lots of pixelization especially when you are shooting something black. I will eventually move up the ladder to the maviva that takes a cd instead of a floppy because that is the other downside... floppy disks are becoming obsolete. I have only had to replace it once (just this year). That's pretty good for a camera that took over 70,000 photos !!!Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,The Best Ebay camera ever made,"In a world where Floppy Disks are a technology of the past, why would an Ebay user order their new computers with a Floppy Disk reader? THE ANSWER... SONY MAVICA FD73!I recently bought a ""vintage"" FD 73 bringing to a total of 4 the number of these cameras I keep in waiting IF my original (now 9 years old) ever fails. I have never found a replacement camera that offers the equivalent close-up quality, as well as ease of use. Granted in the world of Pixel rates, the Mavica at 0.35 trails even the most basic of cameras,BUT more than makes up that shortcoming with its incredible simple quality close up capacity. Photographing items under 15"" in size can prove to be a trial and error process. The Sony gets it right from the first try. Larger format printing, or Ebay photographs of larger items requires a different camera. For my use, the Mavica is my first choice. In a venue like Ebay... PICTURES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR LISTING! Always make them count! The Mavica FD73 Makes them count! Thank you for your time! BOBRead full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Sony  Mavica MVC FD73 Digital Camera 0.35 Megapixel,"I have three Sony Mavica digital format cameras. This camera has a 10X optical zoom lens (40 mm wide angle to 400 mm telephoto). The rechargeable lithium battery lasts for over 175 hours of picture taking or reviewing. Extra batteries run less than $20.00 on E-Bay. They take great pictures both indoors (with or without the built in flash unit)and out.  About 35 pictures can be saved to one inexpensive 3.5in HD Floppy disk in a JPEG format,so forget the hassle with cords and fancy computer interfaces normally required with digital cameras.  No memory sticks or SD cards either. And if you're looking for a camera for closeup work down to about 2 inches, the Mavica's cant be beat. Excellent for taking pictures for E-Bay auctions too. I'm sure that you will be impressed with the first pictures you take using a Mavica digital camera.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Sony Digital Mavica Camera,"Although this camera uses 1.4MB diskettes rather than a memory stick, each disk holds about 16 photos. The diskettes can be inserted directly in the computer to view using windows, no additional programming is required. The camera's physical size makes it easier for people with arthritis to grip so photo's can be taken without blur. It has a 10X zoom; on demand flash; the ability to change the effects of the picture to sepia, B&W, solarized, and negative art; and the rechargeable battery lasts well. And it's simple to use.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Camerazilla-Built for the real world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Hi, this camera is OLD SCHOOL, but TOO COOL! You would quite literally never look at this thing and say WHOA! Hah, I have had multiple new style digital cameras. Unfortunately, they are not made for the real world of constant use. However, this thing is a beast. Solid and functional. Point and shoot. Crazy sharp pictures with the glass lens. Survivor style lens capped construction. Can probably be used for self defense if necessary! Still trying to cope with the prehistoric floppy disk nonsense and vaguely interpretable online manual, but all in all WAY NARLY. Shoots righteous photos and will plug and play in current technology with an external floppy drive. Accessories available everywhere. Makes for the ultimate beginner, or backup camera for super quality pics, and if you invested the time trying to figure it all out,  would probably surpass your(or mine) modern investment for normal needs!!!Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Excellent Price and So Easy to Use,"This camera is so easy to use, especially for someone who is not very good with mechanical things, or very computer savvy.  The best thing about it, is that when you take photos they are placed on a simple floppy computer disk, rather than a memory card, like the newer models.  It also allows you to see the photo that you've taken, before loading it onto your computer. Once the disk is full, you simply place the floppy disk in your computer, and use the drag and drop feature on your computer to transfer the pix into a file on your computer.Another great feature is that is has a zoom lens, which allows you to take photos which look like they've been taken from up close, or from  farther away, without having to move where you're standing.  The lens does the work for you.Actually, its very difficult to take ""bad"" photos with this camera, because its so easy to use.Another good feature is that it runs on a Lithium Battery, which can be recharged, so you're not having to buy batteries all the time.About the only drawback to this camera is that you must have a floppy disk drive in your computer in order to transfer your photos to the computer, so you can print them.  Unfortunately, many of the newer models of computers only have a CD drive.  However, you can buy an external floppy disk drive and connect it to your computer for about $75, which will more than pay for itself in a month or two, considering the price of film, batteries, and the price of developing photos taken with a regular camera.Another drawback is that Sony no longer makes this type of Camera, so if it breaks, it is very difficult to find parts for it, in order to have it repaired.However, it is very well made, and if you take care of it, it will last for years!The reason that I purchased this camera is because I already had one just like it, which got misplaced, and, for me, another type of camera just wouldn't do.  I've since found mine, so now I have two, but I'm still not sorry that I purchased it.  Eventually, you probably won't be able to get these cameras, and I absolutely love it, so now I have a back-up in case mine should break.  In fact, when I have extra money, I will probably buy a third one!For anyone who is basically ""computer stupid"" and not too savvy about camerafeaturess either, this is a great buy.  If you decide to purchase one, I guarantee that after using it for a month, you'll never want to use anything else!The lensRead full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Sony Mavica Camera,"I sold a camera like this on e-bay since I bought a new different camera also on e-bay. I missed this camera, the camera is very easy to use, and takes great pictures. This is the reason I purchased another one.Read full review...",4
Digital Cameras,A great little camera,"This camera is outstanding. It takes excellent pictures and is great if you have an older computer with a 3.5 inch floppy drive installed. I have several of the Mavica series digital cameras and I affirm that they are the greatest thing since sliced bread. I know of a seller who uses these for all of his auctions and he does not allow his employees to touch up the photos. They take detailed pictures of jewelry and art works and antiques. They also do several million in sales on eBay. Maybe if you purchased a camera like this you could set up your own eBay business. Finally, if your computer does not have a floppy drive, you can order an external USB drive and use it to upload the pictures from the Mavica digital camera's floppy disk. Hope this review helps. Type Hess fine auctions in eBay's search engine and you can see some excellent pictures by Jeffery.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Sony Mavica MVC FD73 Camera Review,"This is the third Sony Mavica camera I own, and have worn out the first two taking photos for ebay. I even had the second one, a FD73, repaired several times which was quite expensive and the camera store operator tried to talk me out of it. Finally, I decided, when my old and tired camera quit for a third time, that I would be better off buying a used one on ebay, one without a lot of use, and that is what I did. This camera takes the best ebay photos of any camera around and its well known for this quality. It is a bit of a pain to use the floppy disc storage and many photo shop programs no longer work with a floppy so it might not be suitable for someone new to digital cameras. But, for me, it has been the ideal camera for ebay use and certainly has paid for itself many times over!Read full review...",5

Digital Cameras,"Ancient technology, fabulous close ups","This was a state of the art digital camera in the 1990's.  With a 10X optical zoom and the ability to focus an inch from the subject, it could take incredible close-ups. Great for Ebay pictures of small, detailed items.So, if you still have a 3.5"" floppy reader and don't mind the cumbersome transfer of photos from disc to upload, this is a fantastic bargain.

Digital Cameras,Great Camera.  Just as advertised.  Great pictures,"I like the converience of the disks.  I am able to take them to the store print out what I want, make copies at the same time.  The zoom really brings things up close and personal.  It is not intimidating in taking pictures.  Others know it is there, but you do not need to stop everything you are doing to zoom in.  I just love it.  The convenience, the ability to erase what you do not want and not disturb the others.  I like my 35mm and would not trade, but with this one it gives me the ability to do more.

The camera has an excellent screen, the pictures are easy to get from the camera (if you have a floppy disk drive), the battery lasts long, and it‚Äôs very easy to use as well.

Digital Cameras,THE MAGICAL SONY MAVICA,"This particular digital camera is far from the newest advances in technology. As a matter of fact I have a brand new camera (complete with the dock, a card to insert (or not)). I had a gift of my first Sony Mavica, and the only thing wrong with it was that I had used it so often that I wore the button out.  (to advance or reverse to view the pics) It was very expensive to have repaired so I chose to purchase this other camera. I can only say that I regret that I did and spent plenty of money on it to hang in my closet. I was discouraged as I have a passion for photography. I decided to check eBay to see if there were any of these dinosaurs available. I think my biggest shock was not only were there many, but I was continuously outbid from one then to another. Truly-they are so simple to use, and for a person, like myself, who simply wishes to aim, shoot and get a good picture then I would recommend it to anyone. I'm getting ahead of myself. Yes-I did purchase yet another of the same model number and such. It uses the old floppy disks. For a person who is not technically challenged they would not be interested in an older model such as this model. Sony truly does have a long standing & good reputation. I feel as if I have a trusted old friend back.This is the long and short of the purchase of THE MAGICAL SONY MAVICA.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,"Do not purchase Sony Mavica Digital 0.3 camera, it will only dissapoint you","I purchase this Sony Mavica Camera as a back up camera. The picture quality is poor at 0.3 pixel.  Sometimes the pictures do not print on the diskettes, it looks like the pictures loads but when I try download them no pictures, and the disk suddenly is beyond repair.  Its annoying that I can not produce the product that my customers require.  It has left me looking for another type of camera.  Not happy and fed up.Read full review...",1

Lenses,Awesome lens for an awesome camera system,"I already own the 24-70 f/4 Zeiss lens from Sony so this was an upgrade.  Both lenses are sharp but the 2.8 is so much more than that - far more detailed, much better micro-contrast, faster focusing and nicer bokeh.To be fair the f/2.8 is heavier so you lose some of the weight advantage for which mirrorless cameras are famous; however the step up in quality - particularly when coupled with an A7RII - is well worth the weight gain.This lens, and its 70-200 counterpart, really put Sony out in front of C and N when it comes to mainstay glass.

I held off buying the GM version because I was concerned about the weight.  What a mistake!  The image quality from this lens is so far superior, I wish I had pre ordered this lens when they first announced it.  Not only is the image significantly sharper, the color rendition is beautiful.  Yes, it is heavy, I had to switch from a Peak Design micro strap back to my old Sun Sniper sling, but it doesn't matter the improved image quality is well worth the weight.Read full review...",5

Headphones,Great product at a great price!,"Great product! I was replacing my sony wireless WI-C400 (who's L side just stopped working one day, without any warning)  and these blow them away!! Noise cancelling is great! (Not 100%, but then, neither are earplugs!) Ambient sound function works best when you're not jamming. All in all, I couldn't be happier!Battery life is nothing like the WI-C400, but it will last an entire day!Get a pair... you won't regret it! [Paid $117 for a pair in an ""open box."" Great price!!]Read full review...",4
Headphones,Great with one fault.  ,"I love these headphones.  The only downsize is you have to take one earpiece out of your ear to use as microphone for a phone call.  Other than that, it's a great product.  The noise cancelling is spectacular.  Read full review...",4
Headphones,waiting for nexr generation,"this sony headphone does offer good sound quality and long battery life. However, compare to my overhead 1000xm3, the noise cancelling efficient of this headphone reach 80% of the 1000xm3. Overall, it's good for home, cafe and library use!Read full review...",4
Headphones,noise cancel is decent as a wireless earphone,"The best wireless noise control earphone you can get.2 improvements needed:better batterybetter design on the look, this looks like a dog chain",4
Headphones,Exactly as desribed,"Item arrived in great condition, no issues have arisen so far.So far this item has lived up to what Sony's standards should be.  The sound quality is good, you just have to tune out the hiss with an equalizer, which does come standard with the software.  Then it provides a clear beautiful sound which is great for neckband headsets.All of the features are pretty cool, although the atmospheric pressure setting only really helps if you are flying.Read full review...",5
Headphones,The headphones you need while working from home - $300 headphone now averaging $45,"I have a great deal of wireless headphones...but these are exactly what I've been looking for.let me tell you what's my profile, and you can see if this review helps you: I'm working from home and need to attend calls (avg 5 hours a day) as well as have ""quiet time"" to work on documents and preform research.Call quality is superb, folks on the other end hear me great and clear. I hear them well and I feel adequately isolated from my surrounding.When I'm in my ""quiet time"" I use them to listen to music as well as the noise isolation (works even if you have nothing playing).I use them around 6-9 hours a day, and they last the full day with no need to charge.As of April 2020 you can get used ones for as low $30. I have 2. Keep in mind these used to cost close to $300Do NOT be tempted to go with the newer version (M2), as the battery life is better on the older model as well as the sound isolation.Read full review...",5
Headphones,My favorite outdoor Hi-Res Bluetooth Headphones,"I listen to only hi-res flac files on a Sony Walkman. These headphones are fantastic for any money. I have headphones that cost thousands of dollars. These are my go to's for bluetooth when I'm traveling or laying in the sun, or at the beach. If you can't get the sound right, it's because the tips are not fitting properly. Keep changing tips until you get a good tight, comfortable fit. The 3 levels of noise cancelling is perfect. I like them so much I have 3 pairs so  that I have backups. Whenever I loan them out, nobody wants to return them. I end up buying another set. I use Sony IER-Z1r when I don't have to be moving around or worry about sweating or damage.Read full review...",5
Headphones,I want my money returned !!!!!!!,"I was sent a used headset with crumbling ear wax all over the headset, and scratches all over.

Headphones,These Sony active NC WI 1000s are awesome!,"No more Bluetooth disconnect! Great sound! Cut out a lot of background noise!

Headphones,Worth the investment; bought twice,"I bought these headphones last year and ended up ruining thatpair but having water get into the charging station. I tried buying a different brand to compare to these Sonys, and I ended up giving those away to purchase this product again.Read full review...",5
Headphones,Good for listening to music,"This product is easy to use and charge. I was planning on using this device to make phone calls while working from home; however, the microphone is built into one of those small side pieces. So it is hard for the caller to hear me, unless I speak very louder or hold up the side piece. The quality feels fine; however, the magnets in the actual headphones are not strong at all. The cord that connects them moves around, more than I expected, when I wore the headphones while walking around. The sound quality is great and I do wear them time to time when watching something on my phone or listening to music. I think these are good for the price if you just want something lightweight and easy to use for music and videos.Read full review...",3

Headphones,Sony headsets,The sound is great and they fit comfortable in your ear.

Video Game Consoles,Very happy so far ,"Love it, has been working perfectly for me and have put quite a few hours on it playing fallout 4.

Video Game Consoles,Great Buy!,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He LOVES it. At first, I was concerned it would hardly get used (or worse, used too much). However, I was thrilled to realize that it could download my favorite apps like Hulu, HBO, Netflix, Crackle, etc. Now, it‚Äôs stays in the day room and we watch movies on it mostly, but the graphics in the gameplay is incredible! I can also play my favorite music on it too! So that‚Äôs my review. I love it! Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,My first console!,"I have been a PC gamer since the late 80's and the only console I ever knew was an Atari 2600. Fast forward 30 years and I'm still plugging away at PC games, when a friend of mine says to me why don't I try out gaming on the PS4? The prices on PS4 slim models had come down so far that it became a viable option to try out as an alternative to PC gaming. I have owned my PS4 slim for about a month now and am very happy with it. I own Minecraft Story Mode Season 1, Skyrim Special Edition, Divinity Original Sin and a few Borderlands titles. I own a 4K set and the PS4 looks great on it. If you are still holding out on getting into console gaming, hold out no more and get one of these PS4 slim models at these great prices. Enjoy!Read full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,Stoked,I've been waiting so long to update my ps2 and I couldn't be happier. I started things off right by perching the 6 in 1 kingdom hearts PS4 bundle and it was an amazing choice. I'm working my way through lots of single player games right now but I do wish there were more multiplayer games with splitscreen. I do not feel excites about BF2 yet but I could change my mind if the updates turn out okay. But definitely a great choice for all the old school Sony fans out there.Read full review...,5
Video Game Consoles,Great product.,It was given to my 17 year old son as a gift and he has found no fault with it. And guess what ? To purchase a brand new PS4 with 1TB hard drive for $285 is more than a deal.  Excellent graphics. It's great !Pedro.Read full review...,5

Video Game Consoles,My Playstation 4 1tb was delivered fast.,I would of rated 5 stars but there's to reasons I haven't yet. 1 I noticed there's a rattle inside the system.

Video Game Consoles,1GB Slim is all you need,"Let's face it, the PS4 Pro isn't worth the extra money.  You don't even get a 4K player like the Xbox One S provides.  Until PS ups their game to match what Microsoft is doing, the slim version of the PS4 with 1GB is all you need.Read full review...",5

Lenses,Good Sony A6000 Telephoto,"Pro: Very sharp pix and reasonable aperture for the price.  Gives excellent results even from a  pretty fair distance (e.g. concert photography).Con: Sticks out pretty far relative to the size of the A6000; even moreso (a bit awkward)  when zoomed all the way to 210mm focal length.  You get used to it after some experience and the photo quality is the payoff.Summary:  Good value. Basic quality, function, sharpness, and 'flatness' are just fine.  It's economical so just the thing if you want a starter zoom telephoto for your A6000.   Recommended.Read full review...",4
Lenses,"A little soft, but good zoom.","Overall it's a decent lens for the price, and it has oss, which is a big plus. It's not bad, and does the job, I just wish is was a bit sharper.",3
Lenses,Best bang for your buck telephoto,"Great lens for the price. You get what you pay for. Obviously you could drop a ton of cash on a higher quality lens, but if you are looking to expand your range of focal lengths on the cheap, this is it! Occasionally I get a shot with a bad lens flare, but overall I've been very happy with the image quality. This is a great deal, especially used. I paid $130 after shipping for mine.Read full review...",5
Lenses,Good Inexpensive Outdoor Telephoto Lens,"This lens is lightweight and has a good outdoor reach.  It does not focus quickly indoors, but works well outdoors.  It will often not focus in low light.  However, it is very inexpensive and study enough.  If you are looking for a cheap well-made telephoto for outdoor daytime use for your Sony A6000 series camera, this is a good lens for you.Read full review...",4
Lenses,Good partner for the A6000,"I wanted something made to work flawlessly with my A6000 and I wanted auto focus. I Haven't had a chance put it through it's paces, but first use, I'm happy with the lens. Seems nice and sharp. Maybe not as sharp as a more expensive lens, but for the price and my use, It's great and works well. A little on the long side, but it's light.Read full review...",5
Lenses,Sony E SEL55210,"While not the fastest. Nor the longest telephoto zoom available for Sony NEX cams. It dosent focus the fastest.But it captures images that look very real and the color space is very close to human vision when coupled with Sonys FS series camers.  Sure most FS users go with the Sony G series of lenses at many Thousands each.I grabbed this SEL55210 on eBay for $109 cnd.Yes under $110 to my door!Ok, Spielberg wont be asking to borrow it for his next shoot in TO.  But for my esoteric shooting and keeping my creative mode woking when sitting kn k e of lifes set backs, it's a very good choice and the images are nice.Read full review...",4
Lenses,good lens at decent price,Good Sony telephoto lens mainly in outdoor use with plenty of light. Decent stabilizatio  and nice close up pics with good bokeh at mid zoom but at full length zoom gets grainy and unsteady without a tripod. Otherwise a good buy for the price. Good build quality for Sony A series cameras.Read full review...,4
Lenses,Necessary Evil,"Compared to the Sigma prime lens I have, neither of the Sony lenses (55210 nor 1650) produce a very sharp image. But that is expected given these are 3x~4x zoom lenses. OIS helps alot in these focal lengths. This is pretty much the best and only option for a E mount zoom lenses at this price range.Read full review...",5
Lenses,Lovable lens,"This lens is excellent producing clear pictures of natural color. Nice bokeh. Focus is fast. Although I wish the body could be a slice shorter but it is light enough and sits on my Sony A6000 nicely, Picture quality can be ranked high level. I wish Sony could make a similar one with a wider angle then it would be perfect and definitely an all-around lens without any additional gear.Read full review...",5
Lenses,"Works great with the Sony A6000 series DSLRs for livestreaming, or making prints no bigger than 11x14","I needed a zoom lens for internet livestreaming that could focus on the speaker's slides on the screen for  their presentation with the camera being in the back of the room. This prosumer lens works out perfect for that application. It's not quite as sharp as prime lenses, nor professional zoom lenses for 5x the price, but it's sharp enough that no one will notice the difference for most applications where you don't need an image bigger than 11""x14"" and certainly works wonderfully well for commercial video that will not be enlarged off a computer screen.Read full review...",5
Lenses,Better Than I Had Expected,"This lens is better than I had expected. I have taken some very nice shots of birds flying, seals, and sea lions. They are nice and sharp. I can't say how durable it is as I have only owned it a couple of weeks, but it seems well made. The only disadvantage would be the maximum aperture of 6.3.  I also, like that it is manual zoom only.Read full review...",4
Lenses,Great Telephoto lens for the price!,"Great zoom lens for the price. I just started using it but mostly in concert settings so I haven't tested it much in other settings but it performs well In low light, I admit it could be better but overall it's a great lens. Quick to respond and the image is sharp. At high iso in low light, you would have noise with most zoom lenses over a prime lens anyway so its expected.Read full review...",5
Lenses,TelePhoto goodness,The Tele. is a good accessory to have in your bag. Especially since the a6000 come with a 50 mm lens. I have always like 135 for portraits. I gives enough of a closeup to give good results.,5
Lenses,"Lightweight, nice lens","Size is slightly big compared to kit 16-50 zoom but lens itself is quite lightweight.  Not the sharpest until F8 and focusing seems slightly slow.  However, on the A6300, this lens gives equivalent of 315mm on the long end, so nice reach in small package.  Thought about the 28-200 zoom but this lens is slightly sharper.Read full review...",4
Lenses,Good lens to have,"For the price. You really can't go wrong. The only down fall of this lens is that you are limited with what you shoot. For example (no wide shots).I also really like the colors this lens can produce, as well as its bokeh effect. Others may say different. But if you're on a budget and need something affordable to get you a longer range of a shot, I recommend these until you can afford 18-135mmRead full review...",4
Lenses,Essential first extra lens in a Sony a-6000 kit,"Nice photo quality for the price. I use it as often as I use the stock lens. In the next lifetime, however, when I'm rich beyond all imaginings, I'd upgrade to a Zeiss for the better picture quality.",4
Lenses,Initail evlauation,"So far, so good. About what I expected from experience with similar lenses. The only negative is slow auto-focus in dim light conditions. Probably best to use manual focus option.",4
Lenses,Good lens for the value,"Although it is not the best in low light conditions, the use of an external flash helps to improve it and still get sharp pictures. For its value, it is a great zoom lens that comes in handy for every day photographyRead full review...",4
Lenses,A must buy!!!,Awesome lens. Sharp all the way to 210 mmNice bokeh. Very pleased.,5
Lenses,Sony SEL55210 is a great zoom lens at a budget price,Great zoom lens for a low price.  Took a pictures of Ospreys at max zoom on a tripod and it came out nice and sharp!  I highly recommend the Sony SEL55210 lens.,5

I paid less than 1/3 the retail price for it in like-new used condition on eBay..very happy.Read full review...",5
Lenses,not the best but very ok for refurbished item,"The lens has distortion even when zoom is not being used, image gets ""rounded"". Manual focus is not really manual (at least on my Sony nex-c3),every time i try to use the ""focus wheek"" it zooms the picuture so I have to use switch to ""precise zoom"" configuration in order to work as I want to. Overall image quality is ok and very acceptable for beginners or people that don't want to invest much moneyIt's not worth it's original price but is very worth if you buy it refurbished (which is half the price or less).Read full review...",3
Lenses,Sony 18-55 OSS e mount lens,"Certainly not the best lens out there but if you shoot at F8 it does pretty good. I purchased mostly for video recording because of the OSS and zoom range. If you want maximum sharp look to the 19,30,60mm primes from Sigma.Read full review...",4
Lenses,Very nice object,"Definitely happy with my purchase. The lens is in perfect shape and works great! The zoom mechanism moves fluent and with no slacks. The overall image distortion at 28 is much less then the one shown by the ""standard"" power zoom lens (16-50) normally sold with Sony alpha cameras. Of course, this one (18-55) is not as small and portable as the other, but I think that one must decide which is his priority: shooting good pictures or saving space in the suitcase ....Read full review...",5
Lenses,Great!,"The lens is great! I was looking for a replacement since the one I had broke and this one is a perfect replacement.

Lenses,great addition to the PXW-FS5M2,Fully functional with the PXW-FS5 II video camera. I think It translates into a 26-80 MM lens with the super 35 sensor. good for interviews and all around opening shots as well.,5
Lenses,It was convenient,But it was my 5th lens for my a6000. I got fed up with the big camera bag syndrome so I sold it all and got a RX10 mk2. I feel the relief.

Video Game Consoles,Incredible amount of entertainment for your money.,"Aside from cosmetics, the God of War edition of the Playstation Portable is a PSP-2000 model. I looked specifically for this version, because not only is it the only red one we can get stateside, but it is also a guaranteed TA-088v2 motherboard - the last version that can be used for flash-based homebrewing. Unlike other used PSP-2000s on the market (which may have the TA-088v3, or may not), this one is guaranteed. What is the difference you ask? Enabling homebrew on a TA-088v3 or later motherboard is still possible, but there are limitations, including:a. Must have official firmware version 5.03 or lower, or there is no chance of using customized firmware (CFW).b. Loads CFW into the system RAM, not the actual flash memory, meaning that every time you shut down the PSP, you must re-enable it. Keeping it in sleep mode is fine, but this can still be a hassle.CFW aside, the differences to the other models is minimal.Compared to the PSP-1000, this version feels more flaky and cheap, as the design in mind was to keep things compact+lightweight. The PSP-1000 is certainly more durable. However, the speaker location is improved from the 1000, the ""square button degrading due to slamming into the motherboard internally"" problem has been fixed, and the WLAN switch is moved to a better and less-likely-to-be-broken location. Also, the 2000 has the addition of mic input (sold separately through a special headset) and also TV-Output capability, allowing you to play PSP games on your TV at 720x480 resolution via composite cable. Other than durability, the design is overall significantly improved. The LCD screen is the exact same, but the internal RAM increases from 32MB in the 1000 model to 64MB in the 2000 model. Also, as the PSP-2000 comes with a 1200mAh battery as compared to the 1000's 1800mAh battery, you can expect 4-6 hours of battery time full charge instead of the 8hrs that 1000 produces. Additional batteries with larger storage capacities are available from 3rd parties.Compared to the PSP-3000, the feel is pretty much exactly the same. However, the 3000 has a much improved LCD screen (the scan-line problem many early 3000 models faced has been dealt with) that is not only brighter but also provides a much higher contrast and color range. Also, the 3000 has a built in mic that the 2000 doesn't. All other features are the same, including TV-Output.Aside the model differences, the system is amazing. It is capable of not only games, but also music, video, internet browsing, Skype, and connecting to your PS3 wirelessly and playing PS3 games while away from the PS3. The only gripe that might be had is comfort - hand cramps may occur after prolonged play if you haven't adjusted to the system (however, there are accessories to alleviate this problem if desired).Even with all of these functions, 95% of the reason you're going to buy this console is about the games. The library is huge, and expanding. There are many games for fans of all genres, and multiplayer ad-hoc is available for many games as well. For a few select ones, you are able to play on the Playstation Network against people around the world, and with a PS3, you can also play certain games designed for ad-hoc multiplayer only (such as Dissidia: Final Fantasy) and play vs. people gathered on PSN. The entertainment possibilities are endless.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,big screened wonder system!,"Pros:Massive beautiful screen!Lots of online video and audio to enjoy with the web browser and PSN store.Skype is cool and usefulPlenty of accessories to chose from and allow you to customize your PSPActual 3D gaming, unlike the DSi/DSPhysical controls, the iPod Touch/iPhoneUser changeable battery, unlike the iPod Touch/IPhoneExpandable storage, unlike the DS or iPod Touch/iPhoneThe 2000, 3000, and PSP GO are able to output the screen to a TV, unlike the DS/DSi or iPod Touch/iPhoneRemote playback with the PS3 is fantastic!  It lets me play any video or audio from my PS3 no matter where I go!Cons:The physical controls are a bit different from the PS1/2/3 controller, the buttons are in the same places, but there is only one analog stick, you cannot compress the analog stick (L3/R3) and it only has one pair of trigger buttons.  The games mostly make up for that.Summary:The PSP is a great system for entertainment on the go with its web browser, media player, and numerous games, speaking of which, God of War is probably one of the best on the system.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,best bundle and rare,"Pros: Incredibly attractive casing (the pictures do not do it justice). Very lightweight, equal batter life to the PSP ""fat"" but with a much lighter batter (which means more efficiency!) The screen is my favorite feature when comparing it to a PSP ""fat"". It's so much brighter and clearer.Cons: One caveat on the looks; the ""PSP ring"" on the back of the UMD drive is an almost pink color. I think it would look much better had they kept it as a silver aluminum.Other Thoughts: I'm using 4.01 CFW. Pandora's battery coupled with an M33 autoloader on a MemoryStick is the fastest and easiest way to get CFW on this puppy. Just make sure you change the driver to the M33 or you'll get errors (with the Home or Select button). No dead pixels on mine.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Great bundle!,"I like the fact that this PSP is different, being red and having the Kratos silkscreened on the back.  I also love the Chains of Olympus game and the movie Superbad is hilarious.  I did a lot of research and noted that the PSP3000, in an effort to improve video, actually degraded the video quality.  After a few hours of playing time, I have no complaints with the video on the PSP2000.  I get around 3 hours battery life with continuous playing, even with the WiFi on.  Ordered an extended battery anyway, just so I'm set for long plane rides.  Got this to travel with and it's exactly what I was looking for.  At $150 for the PSP, the God of War game, the Superbad movie, Madden 09, Tiger Woods 08 and a 2Gb pro duo memory stick, this was a great deal.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,The Good & Bad,"Great product, especially if you have a PS3. Lots of downloadable games on the network, it can play games for PSP, PS1 & Minis. The Remote Play feature is fun too, you can play movies & music from your PS3 anywhere that has internet access. My complaints 1. It can't play PS2 games (it seems Sony wants 2 keep PS2 games for the PS2 Console only) 2. The 1000 & 2000 series has no mic but you can get the psp camera to fix that. 3. The battery life is about 4 hours. 4. Beware of bundles with games on the memory stick, once you register the PSP in your name on the Playstation Network, you no longer have access to them.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Great handheld system.,I have nothing but good things to say about this item so far. The handheld stands out with its bright red color and the smaller size is quiet nice. I've found the system to be very easy to use and its a great media device to have.Read full review...,5
Video Game Consoles,Sony PSP Limited Edition: God of War,"This God of War PSP is a Limited Edition and is somewhat difficult to find.

Video Game Consoles,esta en buena condiciones,es genial me gusta,5
Headphones,Best design,The instructions don't exactly say how to pair the Bluetooth with your iPhone. I guess that's not really a problem for most people who already know how to do that with Bluetooth. I found a video eventually and figured out you have to hold down the power button longer than 7 seconds from the off position to pair it. Other than that I had no problems and the sounds quality is good. It works like 10 feet from my computer and more than 20 feet from my phone. Awesome! Except of course when I lose my phone while using them.....I also like how I can listen to the headphones in bed and I don't wake up with it wrapped around my neck like conventional headphones. When I use conventional headphones like that it wears out the wire on the part where it plugs into the phone and I have to keep buying them again every week. This is much more cost efficient! And you can use them while you work out and not have to worry about where you should hold your phone when listening to music/podcasts. just stick it in my bag and forget about it until I wanna listen to something else. No more fighting with the cord!Read full review...,5
Headphones,Sketchy sound,"I listen to NPR a lot during the day and for whatever reason, the sound quality gets very poor when streaming it. It sort of skips and also crashes & I‚Äôll have to close the app then restart it. I‚Äôve got another set of Bluetooth earbuds and a Bluetooth speaker and don‚Äôt have this problem at all. Also, I can rarely control the volume with my phone & need to use the volume switch on the unit to do it. I like the design, but not the performance.Read full review...",1
Headphones,They're worth it,"Great sound, excellent price. I bought 2, one will link up and the other won't.Took a minute to link up first pair to my phone but now it links up automatically, no luck at all with the 2nd pair. They fit tight around my neck, not made for big guys but are manageable. They're perfect when I'm riding my bikeRead full review...",4
Headphones,Just what I want in fit..,The bluetooth earbuds worked well and allowed me to lay on my side to listen to books and music. The only issue was the instruction manual was missing. I had to go online to get how to get needed information about the device. Package was damage from being opened.Read full review...,4
Headphones,Sound quality good and battery last very long,"Sound quality good, comfortable, lightweight and stay on my neck when doing bench press at the gym. I use it at the gym every day for about 2 hrs of training and the battery charge last at least 1 week.  I like the nice feature about the battery power level that you can see it by pressing the on button and a blinking red light tell you how much power is available and also there is voice that tell you.Read full review...",5
Headphones,lightweight head phones with great features,"I like these head phones very much. They wear very well and sound very nice. They work well with my I-Phone and my Galaxy S8. This is the 3rd pair I've owned in 4 years. I only have one draw back with these head phones, the wire from the receiver to the ear buds is a bit fragile. The wires can be easily broken or torn, if they are miss handled. Sony replace a pair for me no charge when one side stopped working.Read full review...",5
Headphones,Light weight and long battery life.,The headphones are very light and comfortable to wear.  The battery life is purported to be about 20 hours but I have not used the headphones enough to verify this.  The restraints for the wiring to the earbuds is strange and it doesn't seem to work - it doesn't hold where I try to set it.  I am worried that I might put too much pressure on the wire connection inside the headphones.Read full review...,4
Headphones,Sony Wireless Headphones,I wear them mainly while working out. I love the battery life and they don't get in the way while lifting weights like wired headphones.

Headphones,"So far, so good...","They are so lightweight that I sometimes forget I have them around my neck. Which I love! The sound quality is pretty great. I have not yet tested the distance for connection. A friend who suggested these told me you can get a good 20 hrs of use from one charge. I have not yet tested the call quality. The only con, in my opinion is that the wires connected to the earbuds are pretty flimsy. I'm rough on my headphones so I'll see how they hold up.Read full review...",5

Headphones,Sony WI-C400 Review,The Sony WI-C400 is great for the price.  Lightweight and comfortable.  Great quality Sony sound.  The downside is that the earbuds just hand.  No magnet.  And if you are anything like me you only wear one bud half the time.  This leads to all those cases of only one earbud works.Read full review...,5

Video Game Consoles,"Great Console, Great Price","If you want a brand new PS3 with all the capability of what came before, but at a much cheaper price, buy this system. Better fan, better processing, just a better system compared to the original launch consoles and some of the mid-level later versions. The flash memory isn't much, but you can easily add an aftermarket HDD (don't forget to get the mounting bracket) with upgrade instructions to be found all over the Internet. After my old fat PS3 60GB finally died this year, I did a lot of research on the other PS3 models. I knew that I didn't want a used system, didn't want to spend more than $150 if I was getting another PS3, and wanted at least a 500GB HDD so that I could shift to only downloaded games. By buying this system for $90 and the 500GB HDD with bracket for another $40, I saved between $50 and $70 from buying a similarly speced out PS3 that was brand new.  Mounting and formatting the new HDD took less than an hour, and then I was up and running. Very happy with this purchase, and would recommend it to any PS3 owners that want another new system without putting a major dent in their pocket.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Worth every penny and more!,"The PS3 Super Slim is an excellent system and I have to say that 12GB of space is actually enough as long as you're not putting photos and movies on the device. You always have the option of buying the require PS3 Super Slim hard drive caddy and installing a hard drive yourself. It's easy. Just watch a youtube video on how to do it. Servers for the PS2 were on for 16 years. So either way, this is a great system and support for it will be around for a long time!Side note: I do game console repair... You should NEVER put modern game consoles in enclosed spaces, like an entertainment center. It will cause the system to over heat and then the solder will melt. That's what causes the RED LIGHT OF DEATH. It's best to keep your system on a milk crate, out in the open so it has plenty of room to breath. You can watch youtube videos on how to avoid this too!Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,This Console offers Many things in One Device. But you must need a Good TV!,"This Console Supports Blu Ray,3D and many more.XBOX 360 doesn't have blu ray feature.I bought this Product, Because it's latest and still in Production.and Also have Thousands of Games across,PS4!So if you willing to Buy a PS4, think Twice. Because If you're a gamer, You'll find more games on PS3. It's true that PS4 has More Graphics Quality and Features. But PS3 still on the Market.and more Support for it. Xbox one and PS4 has good design and new Features.I like it's easy setup and features. But I don't like it's design. and Controller also still the same design as on PS1.(rather than Bluetooth and sixaxis Dualshock on PS3)12GB SSD Flash Memory may not enough for DLC's and Updates.So you will need to Buy a 500GB 2.5"" HDD.(I prefer 500GB,5400RPM,9.5mm Height)7200RPM will not suits,Produce more heat.Thinner HDD's(7mm) would not support,But didn't try.To Upgrade HDD, you will need Mounting bracket.on eBay unofficial brackets price trending at 2.75USD.(can install without bracket,but risky.Try google)Best things about this Console - Blu ray support, Bluetooth Controller, Full HD support(Need Full HD TV and HDMI Cable),Dual Voltage (110V or 220V),2.5"" Common Laptop,Notebook HDD's will fit.You will need Good TV, such as SMART TV or HDTV. I have Normal 29"" TV,Composite cables are useless for Normal TV's,So I bought a PS3 to Component cable.and it works.(Your TV must have Component input,at least 480i or 480P)To Hack this Console, You will need ODE-Optical drive emulator(Cobra,E3 Flasher,etc..)and cannot jailbreak.(Firmware Version would be up to 3.55, that's why).I bought this for 200USD including shipping.(Fedex Express)and it was a Good deal.(from Canada,US Canada PAL version)Overall I like this Console, not the Design. PS3 games aren't cheap. You will need more USD's if you aren't a Resident of U.S.A. (example.45USD including shipping to Worldwide for Last of us.)Anyway if you don't have XBOX 360 or need to buy a better console under 200 bucks.Sieg Heil!Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Product was mostly as described.,"This was advertised as a NEW PS3, Open Box item.The PS3 was obviously used for a fair amount of time and was not just an open Box item. However, works without issue and was quite cheap compared to a new product so it is not bad enough for me to need to return the item.The PS3 did not have any noticeable scratches but did have dust build up on the exhaust side of the unit. The operating system was defaulted so it had no user data on it and it was otherwise clean and new looking. The warranty sticker is still intact so it is easy to see that it has never been opened and is not a repaired unit.For the included peripherals,  A new unused DS3 Controller and was included. The power and AV cables were obviously twist tied and put back into a plastic sleeve to appear as though it was new and unused but the ties and plastic sleeves are not what is used from production on new box PS3.All in all, it is a good product that works well and was sold at a very reasonable price. I am happy with this purchase. It is a good used PS3.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,"It really does do everything; music, movies, games, pics & it's easy 2 use.","I bought a PS3 for my in-laws because they were in the market for a new DVD/Blu-ray player. I told them that for the 100 or so dollars they would spend on a 'smart' Blu-ray player would be much better spent on a PS3. It really does do about everything they could want. Plays almost every kind of video codec (i.e. .mp4, .avi, .mpeg, XviD-DivX)except for .mkv which I am sure will eventually be supported via an update. It also allows streaming from Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Pandora and it also will play movies and music stored on another Windows PC in another room.The only thing that this particular PS3 doesn't come with is infinite storage. That's really why I went with the 12GB model was so I could put in a 1 TB laptop hard drive and then it will be the perfect home entertainment system.Read full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,Most stable ps3 for long term use.,It is a more stable system I believe then the phat I purchased this one after my phat 80gb went ylod and the super slim seems to not get hot at all the sliding disk compartment is a little different and kind of annoying but I think it will last a lot longer in general then the past systems I put a larger hard drive in it considering you cannot do much with only 12gb especially considering games like the new grand theft auto require 8 gb for you to install. It has a few minor glitches that I think all ps3's have it will sometimes freeze when browsing the internet and you have to turn it off then on when that happens and sometimes on like HBO go you get not great video quality these are minor glitches that can be over looked and most of the time just require a restart but it is a great system with a lot of great games and this one seems to be the most stable and has no over heating issuesRead full review...,4

Video Game Consoles,It truly does (almost) everything!,"PROS:  Very pleased with the PS3.  It upscales normal DVDs so they look better on your HDTV, it plays Blue-ray discs very well, and offers extra functions that 'normal' players don't have.  You can game with it of course, and the graphics are phenomenal.  You can also surf the web, browse content from YouTube, Facebook, and others.  With built-in wireless and Bluetooth, you have the same connectivity options as a laptop or media center PC.  If you run a free media server app on another PC on your home network, the PS3 becomes a 'Swiss army knife' of a media player, able to play audio, video, and view pictures. (and arrange them into albums)  Of course you can connect a USB flash or hard drive (only FAT32 format I believe) and play content from there, or copy content to the PS3's hard drive if you wish.CONS:-There appears to be a firmware bug such that when you wake it from standby with the controller or power button, it shuts down and must be turned off and on.

Video Game Consoles,"A Great Console, But There are Better Options Available","The older Sony Playstation 3 consoles were, in my opinion, the best made. At release they were priced at a hefty $600 or more, so over the life of the system Sony removed features to make it more affordable. Unfortunately, the 80 GB model removes the PS2 backwards compatibility. To make matters worse, the bulky older model PS3 has a high failure rate due to issues with circuit board flux and thermal paste. If you go with a ""fat"" PS3, your best bet is the 60 GB model, or even a 20 GB if you don't need Wifi capability. You'll still have plenty of fun if you find a good deal on an 80 GB console, but if you just want to enjoy PS3 games and don't need PS2 backwards compatibility I would recommend picking up a PS3 slim instead. For just a bit more money, you would get all the functionality of the 80 GB ""fat"" model, but with a larger hard drive and better durability.Read full review...",3
Video Game Consoles,Good Graphics Like Being Able To Play PS1 and PS2 Games,"With the 80 GB CECHE01 model with 4 usb ports I can play my origional Ps1 games. Bad thing is I had to buy an adapter for ps1 and ps2 memory cards to the hard drive. Better graphics than Wii, sadly not many ""casual gamer"" games, unlike Wii. Another plus is the sd slot for music, videos, and other things. CD, DVD and Blu-Ray player nice also. All around, better for people who like a system to do everything or for more ""hard core"" gamers. Wii is better for families that like to play against each other, or like origional Mario, or Donkey Kong. Fat Ps3 alot bigger than Wii. What you should buy depends on what you want the system to do.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,Sony PlayStation 3 (80 GB) Black,"I liked the PS3 better than the xbox because of the Blu-Ray feature. And another big plus is the free network and wireless connection. This is the best unit out there, I think. If you want more bang for your buck then PS3 is the way to go. The only problem I have with this PS3 is that it is not backwards compatible. I thought I was getting the older version, which is backwards compaitable, but all in all I am still happy. I think Sony did this on purpose to filter out and get more money from Playstation users. I had to give up my PS2 Slim and God of War 1 and 2. But hey I had an ungrade though to a PS3.Very nice piece of hardware, it's 2010 people soon to be 2011 and if you don't have a PS3 yet then go out and get one. This is going to be around for a good amount of years. Everyone else needs to catch up.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,Very awesome console. Easly replacing my PC for gaming needs.,Due to the economy and purchasing a house I needed to stop constantly upgrading my computer so much. So I bought a used PS3 to see if I can transfer my gaming life to it. It is a very nice gaming console. Very nice. After playing Black Ops and Socom 4. I have all but given up on my computer gaming. Also the PS3 games are tradable and you can sell them for almost the brand new price after beating it. Unlike PC games where you buy it and has no resale value to it after words. Also PS3 doesnt need to be upgraded.Read full review...,4
Video Game Consoles,"Great ""fat"" model without PS2 emulation.","Good purchase if you want a ""fat"" or as my friend calls it ""George Foreman Grill"" model. ;) But this model CECHL (2008) is NOT the original hardware launched in 2006. This model doesn't have the CF/SD card slots and only has two USB ports instead of the original's four. Most important for collectors or PS2 gamers, this model has no PS2 backward compatibility. The ""Emotion Engine"" that gave PS2 hardware emulation is available in the CECHA/CECHB models only (and ""partial emulation"" in the CECHC/CECHE models). So if you don't need PS2 emulation, and don't mind having only two USB ports and no CF/SD card slots, then this is a great PS3.Read full review...",4

Video Game Consoles,due to my knowlage on how to fix this I would buy again,"this is not my choice version but there are lots that can be done to an old ps3 as long as the  firmware is below 3.55 this one however cannot play ps2 games due to sonys gread. Also alot of the cool features have been striped like the crome accents are now dull looking, two usb ports have been removed so that if your mouse and keyboard are pluged in you can't chare your controler or plug in storage media.This model marks one of the spots for an uglier less expensive ps3. If you ever see the inside of one of these you would be upset to see how much dust can collect inside due to poor design which atacks your blue ray drive first then cakes itself on all the major openings to help heat up and kill your ps3 $ony knows how to get repeat sales , Make the games we love and cut corners on the hardware so the it may be short lived.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,80 gb ps3,first off i had the cechl01 model ps3 before but it broke so this one brings memorys from years ago.  You turn it on and the sound of the fan kicks the mood.  The ps3 slim (2001a) i also have makes LOUD SNAP SOUNDS this i bought to replace that is ALOT  quieter.  Overall i played more than 300 hours in these ps3 80 gbs and i played this all nite.  It still runs queit.  There was a few minor scratches on it but i bought a whole new face plate and cleaned the unit all out and i refurbished it.  I give this model of ps3 a 8/10 because it doesnt play sd cards like older models and only 2 usb ports but it is more reliable due to its thinner cpu and gpu.Read full review...,4
Video Game Consoles,You Will Not Be Sorry,"First, I must disclose that my experience is with the 60GB model and not the 80GB.  I also think you should strongly consider purchasing the 60GB model if you are buying used.  I say this because this model had all the hardware bells and whistles that were taken out of subsequent generations. For those who backwards compatibility is really important for, the 60GB model contains the Emotion Engine hardware of the PS2 thereby making it fully backwards compatible.  The subsequent 80GB model used software emulation to play PS2 games, which as I understand it makes some PS2 games incompatible. It also has flash memory card readers and 4 USB ports. Models released after 2007 had the flash card readers removed, the USB ports were reduced from 4 to 2, and backwards compatibility was eliminated.  So, if any of these things are important to you, a 60GB model is your best bet.  If the size of the hard drive is of concern, it can be easily upgraded by the user with any 2.5 inch SATA hard drive.  My 60GB model now has a 500GB hard drive in it, which is bigger than any stock PS3 HDD.With the hardware alterations aside, the user experience is pretty much the same from model to model. I also own an Xbox 360 so I will make some comparisons to it for anyone on the fence with these systems.  Sony has done a good job of evolving the operating system which originally had some glaring inadequacies when compared to the XBox OS.   Xbox social features are still better developed in my opinion and offers a better online gaming experience.  If online gaming is important to you, Sony's Playstation Network is good enough but Xbox Live is a bit more robust in my view.The graphics are phenomenal no matter what you're using it for.  With this generation of consoles taking advantage of High Definition TV technology, games can look photorealistic at times.  The PS3 also supports DVD upscaling to help your DVDs look their best and of course, the PS3 doubles as a Blu Ray player as well, which also works flawlessly.  If graphics are a big concern for you, neither system really bests the other.  You can often find online comparisons of games released on both the 360 and PS3 only to find the writers straining to find the tiniest flaws in either version.  On 99% of games, the difference in quality is so insignificant that you probably won't be able to tell the difference.  The Blu Ray drive doesn't really give the PS3 an edge in graphics or anything else (besides the obvious advantage of Blu Ray playback).  Yes, it allows to store far more data on a single disc, but since disc costs virtually nothing to produce 360 games can simply ship with two or more DVDs if necessary.The PS3 also works quite well as a Media Center.  It's easy to set it up to stream content from your computer or to load your photos, video, audio or other data on to the PS3 hard drive to view on your TV.  Additionally, the Playstation store allows you to download game demos, full games, previews, and rent or buy movies with a few clicks on your controller.Conclusion: While the PS3 used to be prohibitively expensive and lacked a strong game library when compared to the Xbox 360, the PS3 has done away with both of these problems and the consumer can expect to be quite satisfied with either purchase.  IF you are really in to online gaming though, the Xbox 360 may be  a better fit.  Other than that, the systems are pretty evenly matched in my book and you can't go wrong either way.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Sony Ps3 80gb with red screen of death Issue.,I would be careful when ordering Ps3's with the red screen of death that are outof the warranty period. It isn't an easy fix and you are going to end up payingSony to repair the PS3. They charge $99 and above depending on when your model was purchased and the warranty status.Always ask about the firmware. If it is firmware 3.56 with a red screen error I can bet the machine will have to be sent in for repair.At least you get a new 90 day warranty from sony for your headache of reshipping it back to them for the unit to be serviced.Before you purchase a used ps3 with errors do your homework and ask what firmware it was on when it broke down.or just take your chances like I did and end up sending it in to Sony for repair.Read full review...,3

Video Game Consoles,Does MORE than the newer models! Not made anymore!!!,"I used to have a slim, but I went back to the backwards models because i missed the all-in-one game console this offered. it also has four USB ports and not just two, a power SWITCH in the back, touch buttons on front, and SD/micro SD card and other removable disks that can be inserted and used with this system, plus it can play PS1 and PS2 games. The newer models like the slim and super slim can't do THAT! Although, you must be careful for overheating; do not block the right side vents that expel heat or you may risk your system to the yellow light of death (YLOD). This happened to me YEARS ago when i first got my PS3 of this same model--before the slim was available. I used to play a lot though, now I wouldn't have top worry about overheating as much because I don't use it AS often, AND i don't block the vents/keep it in an enclosed area when on. Don't make the mistakes i did! Overall a great system and they don't make these anymore, if you have the opertunity to get one of these, do it!Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Sony PlayStation 3,"If your looking for a video game system, heres a good place to start. The Blu-Ray option is awesome, making games brighter and able to play in 1080p HD. 80gb is a lot for the average user, but HDDs are easy to find here on eBay for good prices. The system has 2 USB ports, which is a downer from the larger systems 4 USB ports, and Xbox 360S's 5 USB ports. The Bluetooth controllers are one of a kind, having an installed battery that makes it cheaper than having to buy cheap and useless battery paks or batteries for your controller. However, the stick layout can be at times uncomfortable, it keeps the same classic PlayStation layout that was first introduced on the PS1. The system is built like a Turbo sports car. Practically half of the system is the fan, keeping your system free of the famous Yellow Light Of Death, but regular dusting of the vents with a vaacum (not a blow duster) is advised to keep the ports clean. The buttons instrad of the touch sensitive panel on the larger PS3 is a huge step up too.Being an owner of both a PS3 and an Xbox 360S, there really is no difference between the two systems other than controllers, looks and producing companies. Xbox LIVE does have the upper hand though on online multiplayer, but thats what you get for paying $60 a year, whereas PS3s online multiplayer is free. Xbox does have a nicer laid out controller though, but you can buy Shadow 6 controllers for the Sony PS3 that are just like Xbox controllers. PS3 can use wired USB headsets or Bluetooth headsets whereas Xbox requires special Xbox made headsets. But dont let anybody tell you that one is better than the other, they are the same in practically everything. If your a supporting user of Sony, get a PS3 Slim. Its well worth your money.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Bluray Laser Problem,"The one thing I absolutely hate about the ps3 are the cheap blu ray lasers. My first ps3 I bought, I was in the middle of playing a game and it froze. I turned it off from the back and turned it back on. Now it stopped reading all disks, CD, DVD or Blu ray, it doesn't matter. It attempts to load them forever.Some have claimed that this is a software issue and can be fixed from the PS3 recovery menu. You select option 3 in the menu and that restores the whole system and supposedly fixes the problem. This didn't work for me. Neither did restoring the file system do anything.Lastly, replacing the actual blu ray laser is an absolute pain. I wonder if one can replace the laser with one that could actually last for a while.Read full review...",3
Video Game Consoles,Good Product wish Sony was more concern about how long their products last.,"I bought PS3 simply because I collect them for fun. I have the very first Playstation that came out the grey one, then I went and got the PS One, then PS2 Slim and then the PS3 and waiting on PS4 too. This is currently my fourth PS3 in 2 1/2 years, they all somehow became defective. The very first one wouldn't accept games, then the second one got YLOD after about six months, then the third one also YLOD and then it suddenly quit after it was reheated and new thermal paste was applied to it, now I just bought one online and expect it to be here soon.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,crappy,pricing for what i paid for a broken ps3 =-/ but made use of this item!i opened it up to look at it and it was dirty few parts were broke so i had to replace parts to get it up and working again. paying alot for something that cost even more to fix and broken parts was not a good deal at all just really pointless money wasted. after i replaced part and painted it. put a working hard drive in. it worked good. then over heated few mins in to it. so i have to take it all apart but items to fix the over heating. alot of fixing on the motherboard. after few hours i got it up and working again. then in mins it powerd off. find the out the fuse went so had to replace the power supply lmao.Read full review...,3
Video Game Consoles,80 gig PS3 with 2 usb out and no memory cards in,"All in all a good unit.  Not having the memory option for SD cards or whatever the others have is kind of a bummer, but considering 80 gig is usually anywhere from 40-60 gig more than the others, its a good trade off.  The 2 USB only was a little bit of a worry at first. but if you get at least 2 Sony wireless then two off brand it works just fine.  Just remember to keep the Sony ones charged, which again is no big deal because they hold a charge for a long time.  So far no problems with a used model and it has been on a lot, especially with little big planet, great game.  I also like the fact that Sony does not charge for their online gaming, something X-Box should of really considered.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,"Love my PS3, very useful, No problems so far","I received my PS3 last year as a graduation gift for passing my GED, and it has not failed me yet.I love that i am able to watch Blu-ray, and while the quality is slightly better when you use a blu-ray player i think it is satisfactory to just use my ps3. Playing dvds on it is also easy, i got the remote with my packaged set, and i find it much easier to skip the trailers when using the ps3 instead of a standard dvd player.Gaming is fun, the controller is easy to handle, for me at least, and can be charged instead of using batteries so thats great. I dont really use PShome, i find it pointless and boring, but i do often browse through the playstation store. Some good finds in there if you are looking for a demo, or just buy a game right there, often times you can put it on your psp if you have one.It IS a dust magnet though, so it would be good to keep a duster (I use a swiffer) on hand nearby to make sure it does not clog anything up. I also do the cleaning thing where it runs the fan super fast, once in a while to prevent any buildup inside that can lead to overheating etc. Its not in the manual,but you completely turn off the ps3, then while your are turning it back on (in the back) you keep your finger on the power button on the front, and keep holding it there it should beep, and start the fan very fast to help get rid of the dust inside. it takes maybe a minute or two, and i have never had trouble with it. I learned this trick from a game store manager, who repairs these machines often.Overall, prefer ps3 to XBOX360, grew up with ps2 so i am used to it.i think it's easier to navigate, the xbox sometimes still confuses me, but many people prefer the 360 over this.Likes; universal, region-free, useful, plays dvd/blu-ray, stunning graphics, menu is easy to navigate, good soundDislikes; Dust magnet, slow updates and installs(game), less variety for gamesRead full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,ps3 purchase.,"i love the ps3 system period. Its above all other game systems out ""to me"". that being said. i am sorely disappointed that sony is not making the backwards comp ones anymore. i would like to own one brand new again(lost in divorce). but i have a new one and its great too not backwards comp but it will do for now. Blue-ray to internet access its a great machine to have in your home. unlike this wii we have that does nothing but play games and wifi...i dont use it.Read full review...",4
Video Game Consoles,Best Buy you'll ever make on Ebay,"What I love about the Sony PS3 is that it has really cool games to play which will have you entertained for a while. You do not have to pay for Online play with your friends like on the Xbox 360 which is one of my most favorite features. It plays Blue-ray movies which no other gaming console provides. You can connect wireless online to the PS3. The PS3 comes with web browsing capability to surf the web on your own gaming console. Finally its a console that is very hard to compete against, has a high resale value and has very few technical problem such as the Xbox 360's red ring of death that has become popular because of how often so many people have gotten it. Talking out of experience, in the 3 years I had my Xbox 360 Elite I got the Red Ring of death twice. It's not suppose to happen AT ALL ! but it happened to me twice and it has happened to most Xbox 360 owners everywhere AND it will continue to happen. The PS3 has no such technical issue that has a huge problem. The day I got my Play station 3 was the day I knew I would never go back to another console, unless Sony comes out with a newer model. Lets face it, Sony makes absolutely superb electronics with amazing quality that does not break down or have technical problems.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Not a Perfect but Fair Deal,I Purchased a Sony PlayStation 3 - 80 GB Black - the unit works as advertised and I found it to be in good shape as also was illustrated. But here's the kicker I found the operation setup was not in English and with no manual it will take some time to get the language corrected back to English. So if you dealing with this seller be sure to ask more than just surface questions because as far as I'm concerned if you don't ask this seller everthing in detail then as far as this seller goes it really doesn't matter.Read full review...,4

Video Game Consoles,PS3 80 GB backward,"I decided I wanted one of the new gen gaming systems for when I got some down time. I had always been a Microsoft girl but my dad had the 360 for like a year and it crashed twice. The ps3 has been nothing but reliable. I love the online content and how you can download anything from games, to movies, to backgrounds instantly. The cost for these downloads isn't bad either. The online feature itself is free to use which is great. They also have a free online community known as playstation home. It is fun to use but if you are a girl gamer I suggest making a guy avatar. The guys tend to be a little too forthcoming lol.The system has many games that suit all types of gamers so there is no worry of ever not being able to find a game.I have to say that it is the best system that I have ever bought. A great investment!Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,very good,"The graphics are phenomenal no matter what you're using it for. With this generation of consoles taking advantage of High Definition TV technology, games can look photorealistic at times. The PS3 also supports DVD upscaling to help your DVDs look their best and of course, the PS3 doubles as a Blu Ray player as well, which also works flawlessly. If graphics are a big concern for you, neither system really bests the other. You can often find online comparisons of games released on both the 360 and PS3 only to find the writers straining to find the tiniest flaws in either version. On 99% of games, the difference in quality is so insignificant that you probably won't be able to tell the difference. The Blu Ray drive doesn't really give the PS3 an edge in graphics or anything else (besides the obvious advantage of Blu Ray playback). Yes, it allows to store far more data on a single disc, but since disc costs virtually nothing to produce 360 games can simply ship with two or more DVDs if necessary.The PS3 also works quite well as a Media Center. It's easy to set it up to stream content from your computer or to load your photos, video, audio or other data on to the PS3 hard drive to view on your TV. Additionally, the Playstation store allows you to download game demos, full games, previews, and rent or buy movies with a few clicks on your controller.Read full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,Excellent,"It works great, runs smoothly, and has many fun features. The games load quickly and gameplay is very smooth; so far nothing has glitched out or frozen.

Video Game Consoles,Playstation 3 60GB (CECHA01) will be unique playing PS2,"The only PS3 (besides the 20GB) that has backwards compatibility with PS2 and PS1 games without the hiccups, dropoffs and freezing that you get on some of the 80GB PS3 systems.  The 80GB uses software for emulation which makes is glitchy and unreliable with some PS2 games.  Even if they bring back PS2 emulation to all PS3 systems including the new slim models, it will not compare and will be hit and miss with PS2 software.  The 60GB has the PS2 emotion engine (EE) that makes it 100 percent compatible with all PS2 and PS1 games.  So if you have a lot of PS2 software that you love and cannot seem to part with this is the system for you.  I played some Socom 2 and was suprised to see people are still online, probably those who are holding out on buying a PS3 since they dont have emulation right now.  You also get the card readers which is always a plus since you dont have to buy it if you have a slim.  You can use the USB ports on the slim but even that has been cut down to two instead of four on the 60GB, which is another plus.  The difference between 60GB and 20GB is the wireless capability, which for some people is a must unless you have a house that is wired for CAT 5 cabling (newer houses have this as an option which is very convenient when it comes to hooking up to a wired house).  So if your in the market for a used PS3 why not get the best one before they slimmed it and cut it down to what it was envisioned to be.PSThe unit is a power hog and runs hot which is why you see a lot of them suffering from YLOD and being sold on Ebay.  If you are going to get a 60GB system make sure you get the Nyko Temperature Sensing cooling fan to exhaust hot air in the back and the CTA dual centrifugal cooling fan to force cool air in the front.  This should almost eliminate the YLOD that plagues this system.  Both cooling fans are hard to find so Good Luck on you purchase.  Why do you think Sony made the slim, because they know its a common occurence on the older units and its also a marketing strategy (newer, slimmer eco friendly PS3) that is working wonders for them.  So pick the right system for you.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Good system overall,"I bought this as a second unit for my kids. I am an Xbox 360 fan myself but the PS3 seemed right for them. Plus I have a 3D tv so might as well take advantage of the Blu-Ray features. For a used unit it works great. Very fast, quiet, and wireless is a good feature. With the PS4 coming out soon I didn't want to buy a new 3,hence the reason for a used unit.Read full review...",4

Video Game Consoles,"It's so awesome, you'll forget you have pets or children. Buyer Beware! ;)","I originally bought this for my daughter's birthday. Figured the family could also use it on rainy days or when it gets too cold to go outside. However, it's become quite addicting! Even my husband and I play it when the kids are asleep and I am definitely not a ""gamer"". This was a major upgrade from the PS2. You can store photos, videos, download games, go on the internet, and my favorite.. NETFLIX right to our tv! It can also play Blu-Ray DVD's. I am very blown away with this system. I'd say the only cons are.. the noisy fan and the fact that it gets hot rather quickly. I can definitely see that becoming a problem in the near future. I am definitely looking into purchasing additional fans for it before it overheats or has any serious problems!Read full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,This is a good gaming system for people on a budget.,"I've been mostly happy with my new-to-me PS3.  I bought a backwards compatible version because I sometimes feel inclined to play my old PS2 games.  It works just fine for all the games and the movies as well.  My one complaint is that it is a demo model.  I have the code to take it off demo mode but each time I power the machine down it resets to demo mode.  That means that any time I want to play a PS2 game I have to go through the process of taking it off demo mode, which is a nuisance.Read full review...",4

Video Game Consoles,Sony Playstation 3 80GB Metal Gear Solid Bundle,"The 80GB Sony PS3 model CECHE01 is far and away the best PS3 systems to have come out. While the 60GB models came equipped with the Emotion Engine and were purely hardware based PS2 emulation, they lacked the crispness and smoothing an 80GB with Software based emulation could provide.They also came equipped with WiFi, a bay for Flash Cards, SD cards, MiniSD cards, and 4 USB ports as apposed to 2 ports on other models. Put these bonuses together and you have the ultimate PS3 model.In my opinion the new slim PS3s are garbage. Sony decided that in order to save more money, they would remove more and more hardware from the console with each revision; first to go was the PS2 CPU (Emotion Engine) on the first 80GB model. They left the PS2 GPU on there to maintain backwards compatibility, which is a highly sought after feature that Sony pushed heavily when the Playstation 3 was first announced. Among the changes made to the 'slim' model was the removal of the ability to install another operating system alongside the main system software. The ONLY bonus to having a 'slim' model is that the chipsets are now running at 65nm as opposed to 90nm and they consume less power.At least Sony has it all right when it comes to the Playstation Network being free which is a HUGE plus.All in all I am extremely happy with my recent purchase of the PS3 MGS4 Bundle.Read full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,Great gaming console!,"Playstation 3 is obviously the best gaming console on the market right now, what with free online gaming and blu ray drive. This console being compatible with Netflix and many other applications that save time make it the easiest to use console on the market as of yet. The only problem I know of with these consoles (40GB, 60GB, 80GB) is that the massive fan in the bottom of the console will pull a lot of dust into the console over a long period of time. This causes overheating and sometimes internal hardware failure. But most of the time these problems can be fixed by replacing the part or regularly air dusting your system. Overall great system love to work on them fun to play and much cheaper to play online than competitors.Read full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,Friggin awesome system.  Go buy one. 1st or 2nd gen,"I loved the ps3 a lot more before Sony made us make a decision to either have our systems do Other-OS or the PS Network and all that.  That aside i love my ps3, Ive owned an x box since they first came out, and i can honestly say even tho x box live is pretty baller along with in game music play list awesomeness, i think ps3 has x box beat based on pure power and space alone.  Plus the number of x box's having issues compared to ps3's having issues definitely favors the ps3. Just my opinion though.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Good Product,It works good,5
Video Game Consoles,will take as many as i can get.,i bought the ps3 to repair or use for parts.i like it because i have always been a playstation fan sincethe first one came out. what i dont like about it is the cheap thermal grease the company used on the heat sync.cant really compare to the xbox because i think there both good consoles it just what the consumer is into.Read full review...,4
Video Game Consoles,Use it daily!!!,"GREAT product. I love my PS3. I have had it several years and purchased it because it was the cheapest Blu-Ray player around. It plays great Blu-Ray discs and make my surround sound shake the pictures off the wall. Since I have purchased a Mac computer I can now stream music, photos, and videos through my wireless network and I use this function daily. Highly recommend it.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,"Nice product, fun and easy to use","Nice looking, small enough to fit on shelf, well built.  The black color is good for long winters and can be fun with pop corn.  The games are okay if you buy them at the store because this game machine did not come with any fun ones.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Gaming and Entertainment,"What doesn't this console do? High Definition video games, Blu-Ray movies, Multiple memory card reader, internet browser, NetFlix, and a bunch of movie and tv show titles streamed off the Playstation network. You can also store pictures, movies and music on the console, and with 80GB, that is plenty of room. Cordless controllers and optional keyboard and Blu-Ray remotes available. Playstation is not just a gaming console, it is a entertainment center. A must get, if it is this 80GB model, or the new 120GB slim line model.Read full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,lightweight with great features,Iam Happy with the product..............,4
Video Game Consoles,Still super fun despite its age.,"While the PS3 is more than a decade old, it still has a massive library of games that hold up well today. Many games, like GTA V or Gran Turismo 6, truly show what the PS3 was capable of. Games are super cheap to find, and online play is free. There is plenty of reason to own a PS3, whether you have a PS4 or not. It even plays PS1 and PS2 games. My only gripe is that the controllers are cheaply made and break easily. I strongly recommend a PS3. Especially the original.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,PS3 or Xbox 360???,"If you are like me, then you want to know which system to get... the Xbox 360 or PS3.I went out and bought them both cause I couldn't pick which one was better at 1st.After buying them both, and playing games with both, I have to say that the PS3 wins hands down.It has better graphic capabilities.It has a NICE QUALITY built in Blue Ray player.It doesn't have all the RED RING OF DEATH and disc tray problems that plague the Xbox 360.the xbox you have to pay 50 bucks a year to play online, but the PS3 is free. (the xbox 360 Live online is better than the PS3, but not by much)The xbox will give you 720p HD and the PS3 will give you 1080P which is nice.The PS3 games are more durable because they are blue ray discs.overall I rate the PS3 as a solid ""A"" and the Xbox 360 as a ""B-"" because of the high failure rate of the units.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,Works like new,I was looking for the PS3 that was compatible with PS2 games. I bought this one that had been serviced and read it was backwards compatible to PS 1 & 2 games. When it arrived I set it up and it works perfectly. It works with the older PS 1 & 2 games without any problems. I was also able to purchase an extended warranty with this auction. I have it covered for 1 year. The whole family can now play all their games on one machine instead of having multiple consoles on the shelf.Read full review...,5

Video Game Consoles,"I own every portable system there is, and this is hands down the best.","This is like a PS3 in your hands. I travel for a living, so as a gamer this is a no-brainer (especially with a building backlog of PS+ games). My advice is to find a gently used device and get a PS+ membership and keep an eye out for great PSN downloadable deals. PS Vita is a fantastic piece of hardware with false stigma for having no games. Tell that to my full 32 GB card.PROSIntuitive User Interface.Console quality graphics in your hand.Perfect control layout and sticks.Large library of games.Large beautiful screen.CONSFull priced games are expensive ($40).Sony memory card is overpriced, but there's no choice of 3rd party cards.Battery life is only average (3-6 hours)That large beautiful screen should be handled carefully to avoid being scratched.Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,"A+ console. Buy one, you'll love it!","I use this console more than my ps3, psp, xbox 360!They say the average vita user plays it about 40 hours a week and I can believe it, I take this thing everywhere.As a working adult (who also is a gamer) I take this to work and play it on my lunch break so it gets much more use than my psp that (for whatever reason) I never took to work.If your a playstation plus member they have  games you can download for free and play as long as you like. A games you purchased on ps3 often give you a free vita version. It also plays my psp games I bought on psn so I have a ton of games.If you buy a vita with the 3g (like mine) it also has allot of interesting features like ""near"" and ""wake up club"" you can use away from wifi networks.The only drawback is the memory cards do cost allot but.... Trust me on this.... Just buy the 32 gig card and you'll be super happy.I burned through the 8 gig card that came with it fast but with 32 gigs I've only used about 19 gigs of it and my vita is soooo packed with games I couldn't be happier!Its AWESOME!Read full review...",5
Video Game Consoles,If you are looking for a nice hand held system this is the way to go!,"I am in the U.S Navy, and I am currently on a 6 month deployment, and the Vita is perfect for my needs. The screen is a beautiful. The touch screen is very responsive, the battery life lasts about 5 hours, all in all I am very happy with the product.Somethings that can be improved on is to use the analog sticks, and D-pads to navigate the OS, in the home menu. a small HDD would be nice, and it does suck to get new memory cards.All in all, I have had pretty much every Hand held system, and this by far is the best one yet.Read full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,A great console for all those free PS plus games!!!!!!,"My decision to buy the vita was based solely on two considerations: 1 the capability of the hardware, 2 Playstation plus and the cross buy and cross play features.  That said, this is a very limited review.For my purposes, this is a great little system!  I fired it up and immediately downloaded spelunky and hotline miami among some of the other titles that came free with Playstation Plus (a must have service if you intend to get a Vita).  Games download fast on my home wifi and the gameplay (at least on these titles) is flawless and the controls are at least on par with the console versions of the games. The screen is beautiful, the speakers are great for a portable system.  I suppose the overall interface of the system could be slicker, but it is more than adequate as it is.Read full review...",5

Can be lots of fun with the right games, a great way to pass the time when waiting in line or such as you're out and about.

Video Game Consoles,Great Item vs Price,Good Item For The Price. My Kids Love it And Experiencing a Great Time. If You Want Just by One Like That.,4
Headphones,Great item,"The modern style of in-ear headphones is not comfortable for me. They've piled on a great deal of extras (and weight). I prefer the old-fashioned (1990's) style like this model. The sound from these headphones is very clear, subjectively superior to my older model. I recommend purchasing a case, however, as the durability of these headphones doesn't seem to be up to the standards of the 1990's. In addition to Sony's older headphones being apparently more durable, they, along with other manufacturers, used to sell all or most of their headphones with hard cases. For these particular headphones, I'd recommend purchasing a case for one or two dollars. My 1990's headphones still work great, but they'd be long gone if it weren't for the hard case. When I read reviews of this model lasting for a year or two and people being happy with that result, it's disappointing. Earphones can easily last ten years with a case, and possibly even twenty years. Without a case, I'd consider this model way too light duty for my purposes.Read full review...",5

Digital Cameras,Great Little Camera!,"This is the 3rd one of these I bought.  My 1st I bought brand new when they first came out.  It worked for years until I dropped it and broke the flash.  Went to try to find a ""flash part"" on ebay and found the whole camera for $15 so I bought it.  That camera had a ""Lot of Miles"" on it so I looked for another one on ebay and found this one in almost like new condition for about $14.  The great thing about this little camera is that it uses ""STANDARD""  double AA batteries you can get anywhere!   Thanks Ebay!Read full review...",5

Digital Cameras,Bought this camera twice,I originally bought this camera in 2007 from Best Buy. Since then I have purchased 5 other similar type cameras for family members but this Sony was the best. In the summer of 2010 we dropped and broke it.  I have purchased the same Sony Model camera as a replacement and I am glad I did.  Takes clear pictures and is easy to use.  Hold it steady and snap away.  To avoid blurry pictures hold shutter button down 1/2 until auto focus is finished and then snap away.  Accessories are pricy but I already had them.  Camera manual on Sony.com.  I would recommend this camera before any of the newer Sony cameras.Read full review...,5

Lenses,Sharper than I expected,Fast focus on the a6500. Great tracking and awesome value. The best bang for your buck. I'd find myself shooting with this lens over my Sigma 30mm 1.4 contemporary. That lens seem to hunt too much. I was amazed in bright sunlight that the a6500 paired with the 50mm produced such great bokeh without any nd filter.Read full review...,5
Lenses,Awesome lens for the price!,"I was looking for a solid 50mm lens to use with my a6000, and landed on the Sony f 1.8 OSS. I had an 85mm was looking for something slightly wider, but wasn't ready to move to a 35mm and this fit the bill perfectly. Only downside is that the manual focus ring isn't all that sensitive and you have to move it quite a bit to focus shots, but if you're like me and you're shooting mostly inanimate objects, that didn't really bother me too much ‚Äì Highly recommend the ""nifty fifty"" as a first lens, if you're just getting started!Read full review...",5

Headphones,Nice for the price. Better  than expected.,"Headphones connect effortlessly each time I use them. It even tells you upon connection how much battery power you have left. Nice feature. Was very easy to connect the first time using instructions I found online since my package did not include any for whatever reason.Headphones are a little tight but I have a bigger head than most since I am 6'2"" and weigh about 210 lbs. The sound quality is no where near my Bose corded set but neither was the price. These sound a bit muffled but are fine for watching videos, etc. For music, I would use my Bose set.Read full review...",4
Headphones,Great for the price point. Wonderful purchase,"I bought these headphones for $25 and they‚Äôre 100% worth the price. Overall they‚Äôre comfortable and decently built for the cost. The plastic is a little flimsy but the sound is clear, bass is good, and holds a good charge. Little confusing on how to first pair them, but they‚Äôre really good and I‚Äôm satisfied. They‚Äôre great for the gym.Read full review...",5
Headphones,Great affordable head phones,These are great! These have USB type C connection. I upgraded from the previous version. These are less bulky and sound quality are great. Holds charge for very long. Highly recommend if searching for affordable Bluetooth head phones.Read full review...,5
Headphones,Great headphones!,"These headphones are great!  I purchased them as many of us are working from home nowadays.  I have been using them every day for about a month now.  I use them primarily to attend on-line meetings, and occasionally watch videos.  The battery life is awesome.  I have been using them all day for 3 to 4 days without recharging, and I am not pushing the battery.  I have not tried to see how long it will actually last.  The sound is excellent.  True, I am not using them to listen or record high fidelity music; but when I watch videos, the music just pops - deep bass, great treble.  They are light weight and decently comfortable.  I don't give them the highest marks on comfort only because the ear pieces land on your ear, instead of covering it completely (all around it).  But still, not bad to wear all day.  Bluetooth connection is very solid - no drops.  One not so good point is that the charging cable that comes with them is only 8-10 inches long.  Not even long enough to plug a charger on the wall and having the headphones rest on the floor.  So, your choices are, get an electrical extension to put them on your desk, get a longer charging cable, or use the short cable to plug them on a USB port on your computer; however, if your computer goes to sleep - no charging.  Excellent headphones nonetheless!Read full review...",5
Headphones,Great for the price and features,Long battery and good sound.  Very satisfied with purchase.,5
Headphones,Great and reasonably priced.,"I didn't want to spend too much on headphones so these were a great middle ground when I had to switch to wireless. I like this design better than earbuds. They have a good range and the battery seems to have a good life. There is some compression as with pretty much any Bluetooth device, but I think the sound quality is very satisfactory.Read full review...",5
Headphones,Nice quality,These inexpensive headphones are very good for the price point. I rated them a four star only due to the fit. You can‚Äôt really adjust them for a smaller head circumference so they kinda need adjusting when I‚Äôm working out.Read full review...,4
Headphones,Definitely a pleasant surprise,"Recieved the pair promptly, before expected. Arrived with next to no sign of usage. Note it is a supra-aural setup, but sound quality is comparable to my Cowin pair of triple the price range. I think the lightweight quality is the product's appeal. Nothing disappointing about this.Read full review...",5

Video Game Consoles,Great upgrade from the slim if you doin't mind the fan,"The PS4 Pro is a slight upgrade to the slim model. Having owned both now, I can say I do see a difference in the graphics, colors, and shades. It also has slightly faster load times and much less slowdown during gameplay. The only thing keeping it from getting a perfect score is that its fairly noisy. When the internal fan kicks on, you will definitely notice. Otherwise, a great system and probably my favorite Playstation system since the PS2.Read full review...",4

Digital Cameras,The Camera have proven to be Excellent for some people,"But the Technology and quality of the pictures can't compare to the new cameras.I work as a teacher and have taken't 1000's of pictures with the camera I have.I must say it's basic/simple to use and bulky and big by today's standards. Not always a disadvantage because small cameras can be too small for a big person/hard to see. Although I had a problem with another camera that the harddrive died after on a couple of years use 2 out of three have proven to be hard to destroy. Student's are hard on equipment. Over the years I've really gotten to like the simplicity of the Arch software that come with the camera it's easy to use. The verizon that I have like all use a floopy drive while other verzions have a memory stick. The floopy disk have advantages because individuals can take their disk with them. Sometimes the floopies fail so you may loose your picures. Only ocassional if the floppy has wear and tear.The camera isn't worth fixing at least by Sony because even way backthey charge 160.00 just to look at it. The Camera I have can take a 30 second video on the floppy. The camera has no storage unless you have a floppy in the lower verzion or have one with a memory stick. The camera can download to other equiptment but I really never used those features. I would reccommend to buy a better quality battery becauase the cheap ones down hold a very long charge.I would say when you get use to the camera that's it's user friendly. Originally these cameras when for around a thousand dollars. My camera has worked for around 9 years. Update- 2010 - The new cameras are far more  advanced and this has become a dinosaur. Buy a Sony CyberShot 12mp and get a chip reader. Great pictures, Videos and easy selection. I have a Kodak 10mp and I don't like it because it's undependable and has other problems.Using the download cables doesn't do it. I still like the Archsoft software which you can buy from the company directly.Read full review...",4
Digital Cameras,Love it,I've had my Mavica for around three years now and it takes beautiful pictures. I think storing your pictures on a disk is an excellent idea. I've dropped it several time and it kinda banged-up but it still work as good as the day I bought it. I also have a 5 Mega pixel camera and I can't tell much difference in photo quality between the two. Another thing I like about the MVC-FD88 is the fact that you can manually focus it which comes in quite handy some times. It's a great all around camera and very simple to use. I personally love it.Read full review...,5
Digital Cameras,Sony Mavica FD88 Review,"I just purchased my 2nd Sony Mavica FD88.  The 1st one I owned I bought almost eight years ago at a price of over $800.  I'm computer illiterate and I wanted something simple to use, so the floppy disks meet that requirement.  I have faithfully used my camera for years, for many reasons, including photographing items to sell at ebay.  Not long ago a disk got jammed inside the camera and I tried to pull it out with a tweezers.  The piece of metal/plastic that slides across the floppy became jammed and disengaged from the floppy when I pulled it out.  I was eventually able to get the piece out, but since then the camera cannot read any disk I insert. So, in actuality, this eight year old camera worked fine until the (defective) disk jammed and caused a problem.  I felt lost without my Mavica the last couple weeks, even though I own another digital camera.  You just cannot beat the convenience of the floppy disks!  Even though these are no longer made, I would highly recommend purchasing a used one if you know it is in good working order and you can get it at a fair price.  It's a great camera and takes great pictures.  I don't mind the bulkiness, since I tend to drop things easily and this camera gives you something to hold on to!Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Sony Mavica MVC FD 88,"We had this camera before and for some reason the floppy did not work. We loved that camera, I am a realtor and take pictures of homes and properties with it.I am not computer smart and this camera is so easy to use. We have a wide angled lens with it and it takes the greatest pictures. Just a click and when I get on the computer I insert the floppy and have the most beautiful pictures.It sure takes better pictures than my small digital camera. I highly recommend this camera for anyone that loves a clear,large and beautiful pictureRead full review...",5
Digital Cameras,The late Mavicas are usually good values at  $25.  They are very tough cameras of an advanced design for their date of mfg.  They are still useful.,Verified purchase:¬† Yes | Condition:¬†pre-owned | Sold by:¬†cactus_finds,4
Digital Cameras,Great Camera With Great Features,"I've had this camera for about 6 years now,picture quality is great and it makes for good prints up to 5x7, a bit grainy for anything bigger.awesome camera for web pictures, I've taken pictures for ebay items at only and inch away with perfect focus with the macro option or at several hundred yards away at sporting events with the 10X optical zoom and extra 4x digital zoomhas great features including video options and manual focus.  it's a bit big because of the floppy disk format, but at average resolution I can get 15 pics on one disk.I've taken hundreds of pics of my kids with this and they always come out nice and crisp images.Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Floppies and Fun,"The Sony Mavica is a great digital camera for your eBay photos. It takes excellent photos, has an incredible zoom, and has a sturdy build. It also uses floppy disks to save its pictures, so you will need to have a floppy drive nearby to load your pictures onto a computer.Despite its age and its sometimes awkward, sometimes fun memory format, the Mavica is well worth your money if it is purchased as a full time eBay camera!Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,Great Value! Great Camera!,I love this Sony Mavica Camera... It is very easy to use.. The picture quality is SUPERB!!! The only downside is that it is alittle to bulky.. But other then that I would recommend the Sony Mavica FD88.. I LOVE IT AND SO DO MY 3  DAUGHTERS!!!!Read full review...,4
Digital Cameras,Sony Mavica MVC FD88 Review,I am an Insurance Adjuster and use the camera in my work. These cameras are no longer made. The thing I like most is it uses a floppy disk to record the photos that I need for my claims. I can use as many disk for each claim as I need. I put use the disk to down load my pictures for each file. This way I do not have to sort witch pictures go to witch claim. This is a big time saver. This camera also has a 16x zoom lenz. Some times I cannot axcess a roof because it is to tall and or too steep. With the 16x zoom lenz I can take pictures from the ground.Read full review...,5
Digital Cameras,Sony Marica MVC FD88,I love this camera!  Especially the fact that it uses a floppy disc - it's so much more convenient to just pop the floppy into my computer.  It also takes great pictures.  I've had one since they first came out years ago and paid over $800 for my first one.  The only drawback is the size - it's definitely bigger that the newer cameras.  But it lasts forever.Read full review...,5
Digital Cameras,Sony Mavica MVC FD88 1.3 Megapixel,"I needed to buy this camera for work.  It was required by my employer. It is easy to use, takes good pictures and because it uses floppys, I am able to catalog my work.  Great camera for the money.",4
Digital Cameras,this is a great camera for the price cost over $800 new,ths is a great point and shoot camera and has good features  only draw back that I have found is the limited amount of pics to a disk at high  quality resolutions and battery life.,4
Digital Cameras,My Wonderful Mavica,"I don't normally write a review.  But this machine is simply too amazing.  I took several hundred pictures and had no trouble loading them to my computer.  The pictures (VGA) are easier to upload to my website, much better than the higher resolution, since I do not need the higher megapixels.  Sony built this machine very well, and very easy to handle, comparing to my other purchases, a 5 Megapixel from Walmart.  Overall, I bought a few more, a CD350, and CD200, and one more FD88.  Highly recommend the machine!Read full review...",5
Digital Cameras,My Sony Mavica FD88,"A really nice camera even if old tech. For most pictures below 5 X 7 it is excellent.Yes, floppy storage is ancient, in technology terms, but it serves me just fine.This is my second, as a backup, having bought my first one in 2000.I would recommend to a friend, but he/she may desire more recent technology.Read full review...",5

Digital Cameras,Keeps on clickin',"Oh sure, it's 10 years old now. But if you've got kids and can find one working (and a computer with a floppy drive), it's a cheap way to get them into photography without spending much at all. A good stepping stone to a cheap Polaroid or Vivitar digital, and with a bigger, better lens to boot.Read full review...",4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Good value for the money,"This phone is fun and fast. The battery life is okay. I make it most of the day on one charge but if I'm bored and play games I have to plug in. I haven't added music so I'm not sure how that affects battery life yet. The phone is heavier than anticipated but it's not uncomfortable. The edge to edge display is very nice. It has a cinematic feel and doesn't waste space like most phones. The cameras take good quality photos. Colors are true and details are visible. Front camera shifts images and I'm not sure why. On screen it looks good before you snap it but it moves the image over and up in the actual photo, cutting off heads. Changed the settings but it still happens. Sound quality is also good but I haven't played with the equalizer or other sound enhancements. Screen size is great for those of us who don't see as well as we used to. Overall, this phone delivers what's promised and will not disappoint.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Good value but more signs of use than I thought,"Overall it works well, but I wished they put in more effort into cleaning it. Mine had glue all around the edges.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Good deal,"I believe the phone was a fair deal for the money. It came in a simple package with not much but the phone and the charger cable, but, the phone itself looked like brand new! The battery life is fairly good. I love the fingerprint security/unlock feature of it, although I initially resisted the whole idea. The screen is large enough, yet the phone fits my hand just fine. My son spent big money on a brand new S20 when it came out. To me, this phone does about the same thing.Read full review...",5

After having a Galaxy S7 for a number of years, I assumed the upgrades would be minor incremental ones. The phone feels like a completely redesigned phone, has a beautiful screen, very long battery life, great camera and the extra size is nice for videos and editing photos. I would recommend buying this device used. The price for new phones is ludicrous so buying it a year or two old makes things much more manageable.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Only phone out now that doesn't look like an iPhone clone,Most other android phones look exactly like iPhones.

Coming from a wider lg g3 it feels slightly small. It could just be I got use to reaching my thumb to get to the other side of the lg.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Two Dealbreakers,"Awful in that samsung forces you to use THEIR calendar app, so when I downloaded the google calendar app, which I like, I was getting DOUBLE notifications for my event. No way to disable the samsung calendar app.AND... when sending an email from the samsung email widget, or from the general inbox for multiple accounts, the only signature it could use was the one from my default account. Wasn't too helpful when I wanted to send from a different account.For these two reasons, the phone was unacceptable, and had to be returned.Read full review...",1

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Good upgrade from the S7, but almost as fragile as an iPhone.","I upgraded my older Galaxy S7 to the S8.  I like the feature upgrades and additional functionalities that the S8 has added, along with the newer Andriod version that S8 supports.  Battery life seems to be good.  Took a little getting used to as the ""Home"" button is no longer a button, but a touch icon, and the figure print reader is on the back now.  Before with the S7 I could unlock just by touching my thumb to the home button, but now I have to do a two-finger action.  Just took a while to get the rhythm down.My only negative feedback is the S8 is FRAGILE!  Almost as bad as an iPhone! It slipped from my hand and fell about 1 foot, and shattered the screen.  I've dropped my S7 from 3-4 feet onto the same surface without a scratch.  After doing some research, I found that the S8 has a reputation for being one of the most fragile Samsung.  Don't know about the S9.  I had even purchased a SlimArmour case and a StinkLight screen protector, just hadn't put it on yet as I had just had the phone a little more than 2 - 3 hours.  It was $$ to repair.  Overall, it's a good phone and an improvement over the S7.  Get a good case and screen protector and put it on pronto to avoid additional costs.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"great quality, except..","It indeed functions perfectly and has no signs of use whatsoever, the screen is nice and sleek as well as the back. No cracks or anything affecting the looks of display on the OUTSIDE. however, as said, this phone does have screen burn. Though you can hide it with a dark theme on apps and such, but it still bothers me a bit. other than that, the quality and price are great. Read full review...",3
Cell Phones & Smartphones,I love this phone!,"I'm very happy I took the leap and bought the Samsung Galaxy S8!  I had wanted the S8+, but now that I have the S8 I'm very happy with it.The screen is 5.8"", which is big enough, but there are no bezels so the actual size of the overall phone is not huge.  Makes it easier to put in my pocket and hold in one hand while typing.And as far as the 64 GB of storage, I'm not worried about it because it has an expandable SD card slot, so I can expand my storage another 256 GB!I was excited about the fingerprint scanner, but I actually use the bio-metric iris scanner.  Once registered, all I have to do is look at the phone and it unlocks, and yes, it works every time and is super fast.  It doesn't matter if it is sunny, or in my room at night in the dark, it works!Touch Wiz has been updated to something called ""Samsung Experience"" which is nice.  The S8 updated itself right out of the box.  Running Android 7.0 Nougat which is nice!  The headphones that come with the phone seem very premium.I can't say enough about the rear camera.  I also owned a phone with dual 13 mp rear facing cameras, that can't take a picture anywhere near as beautiful as the S8.  The sensors and software that Samsung uses for their cameras' can't be beat!The super AMOLED display has ruined me for life.  It is so beautiful!Fast charge is nice, but the my only gripe is the battery life.  With very heavy use, I get about 6 hours with 15% left.  If I'm having a busy day, and not on my phone constantly, it will get me from 8 am to 10 pm with 10-15% battery left.The glass back is beautiful, and so are the curved bezel-less edges, which makes the phone slippery, and fair warning, they crack and break very easily.  I personally purchased a Rhino Shield bumper guard.  You can still appreciate the beauty of the phone, it is barely noticeable, with military grade protection.Rest assured, it is worth every penny!Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great Phone!,"After having so many problems with LG phones, I decided to switch brands and find a new provider. This unlocked phone can work on any network. I just took mine to straight talk and got the bring your own phone activation kit, and was able to choose between any of the networks to set up my service. It works flawlessly so far! It comes with the necessary pieces to transfer photos, videos, contacts, emails, and more from your old device. It also came with a pair of headphones. I paired it with a ring case (a case with a built in rotating ring to relieve weight from the pinky) and it's the perfect fit for my small hands.The phone itself is amazing and has worked flawlessly so far. It has blue light filtering, one-handed mode, video enhancer, multi-window and more. The camera is stunning and it comes with tons of filter and stickers! I was able to re-download all of my old apps lightening fast on this new phone. After setting up the phone, downloading 30+ apps, using some apps, and tweaking the phone settings, I still have over half of the battery left.I would say this is the best phone purchase I have ever made, well worth the money.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Nice phone for casual user,"My husband bought the Galaxy S8 a couple weeks ago. This is a good phone. The display quality is nice. The phone is not very wide, so my husband gave it to me and bought the Galaxy note 8 which he really likes when he is texting. For me the width is not an issue while texting because I prefer smaller phones. The speaker is also noticably loud and clear. I recommend switching off the always on display if you don't need it because I think it drains the battery much faster and it seems unnecessary in my opinion. I don't use my phone for much other than phone calls, texting, watching YouTube, and browsing the internet.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great phone minus one advanced feature.,"This is a great phone in form and function. I don't have a problem with the rear finger reader like so many have. My biggest complaint is the Bixby button. It launches that app by accident to easily.<br>An oddity on my phone which is unlocked and will work on any network: for some odd reason it doesn't have advanced calling which contains HD voice and Wi-Fi calling. I've called Samsung and Verizon (I'm using them right now) and both say the other is responsible for putting that on so it's not going to happen for me.Spectacular screen, super fast and so pretty. Great camera. Battery life is pretty good. Not a perfect phone but the best I've had so far.No phone is worth $600 or even $500 unless you do insane high grahics gaming or other crazy things that need top scale graphics and speed. I've owned $170 dollar phones that did everything I need (web surfing, videos, texting, calling) just a bit slower and not as nice pictures so that's why I am putting not a good value.But I do enjoy cell phones so every once in a while I play the fool and pop for a flagship.Read full review...",4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"The Good, The Bad and Some Notes","The Good- $899+ bucks worth of hardware for a relatively low price.- Top-grade technical specs.- Face recognition is nuts!- A really, really gorgeous design. Best phone design of 2017 (and 2018 too) IMHO.- Phone feels like it's going to last long, long time. Especially with the IP68 water and dust resistance certification.The Bad- Samsung UI still needs a bit of refinement.- Weird AF fingerprint sensor positioning. The sensor itself also needs some work.- Official Android updates take a little more time than I'd like to.Some Notes- 5.8"" may be a tad too big for one-handed use. A bit smaller would've resulted in the perfect smartphone size for my own preferences.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Glad I waited, quality purchase.","Few weeks in. Aside from a few barely noticeable dings/scratches the phone was in great shape. Battery seems to be pretty healthy. Came Carrier Unlocked and ready to go with proper cables. I'm happy with the purchase. Would buy again.As far as the Galaxy S8 itself, it's a slight upgrade from the 7 but not a huge leap. Worth the money in 2018, but wouldn't of bought new when it came out.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,New to Me,I have never had a cell phone so this is the perfect one for me. It is easy to use and love the size of it. Product was in perfect condition. Would never know it was refurbished.,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great Phone - not compatible with Straight Talk though.,"We were unable to use this phone with StraightTalk.  We tried 4 different SIM cards, and after a month reverted back to our old LG phone.  This is an AT&T Samsung, we needed Verizon come to find out, so they sent a new Verizon Sim Card which didn't work either. Said we'd have to contact Samsung to do a hardware update to try.  This took a month of time with Straight Talk and my frustration level was thru the roof.  We went back to our old LG phone on Straight Talk and I will try and use this Samsung8 on our other Verizon plan... am waiting for a SIM card from Verizon to try.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great value for a great phone!,"Excellent price if you're looking to upgrade without spending too much. Popped in my SIM card and I was good to go! Phone looks practically new, except for a few tiny scratches on the screen I rarely notice. Arrived earlier than expected. The S8 has a lot of bells and whistles - I like to keep things simple so I spent a bit of time disabling some stuff which was easy. I'm never buying a phone at my carrier's store again.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,It is a really great phone with a ton of features for a great price.,It is a really good phone. The android 9 one ui is great  with tons of customisable features as well as dark mode. The phone is not way too large like most phones now a days. But it still has a great large screen. The iris scanner works well and waterproofing is great.Read full review...,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Great Condition, but has an internal Sim Card Reading issue that is costing more money and it's been very stressful.",The phone works fantastic and has a great battery life but I was not told of a SIM card reading error problem that is recurring.  I have to carry my SIM card pen peace everywhere I go because my phone will not read my SIM card at certain points. I have to restart the phone and re insert the sim card for it to work a day if I'm lucky.  It has been happening since I received the phone.Read full review...,1
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great product.,This phone so far has been amazing is in great condition and the minor scratches are not visible at all. The phone feels brand new and very functional. Thanks,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,New Galaxy s8,"The phone was advertised as new. It is. Have never purchased an unseen cellphone before. A bit scary, but was the right thing to do. Took it to my local AT&T. They installed a nano SIM card, (mine was micro), and it wored right away. After using wireless Smart Switch to transfer all info into this phone, nothing but smiles on our faces. Yes I would recommend. ThanxRead full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Brand New Earlier Model Phone for Way Less,"Excellent phone if you don't care about having the latest, greatest version,  which I don't. I'm sure 2 or 3 years ago this phone was 7 or 800 bucks,  but just just got a brand new unopened phone for under $300. I'm replacing my 5 year old S6. Can't go wrong with a Galaxy in my book. Timely shipment and processing. Easy to work with.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Going from a S4 to a S8 was a great improvement - love it...,"Internet and loading info is very quick. Setup was also very easy, however it does require a smaller sim card than my old phone - just a quick trip to Verizon and it was free..",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Wireless charging in a modern fully featured device.,"Even though an older model than current flagships, Samsung is still upgrading the operating system with most of the newest features.  It's almost like a flagship at half the cost.  I love the edge feature for most used apps, the face recognition, and the NFC payment option.  64 GB is more than I will ever need but I still inserted an SD card so I have tons of space.  Battery life is excellent but maybe the most useful is the wireless charging.  Not having to ever plug it in is great.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Lightweight, thin, perfect for me.",A great phone. Has everything that I need. Small size and thin too. Good camera.,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Good phone with nice features..,Large clear display.. Fast  processor nice pictures..,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Good value, Verizon fingerprints are a nuisance","I've had this phone for a couple of weeks and I really like it. The interface features have worked well for me (once I got the hang of them) and the camera is excellent. The only thing that has given me trouble stems from the Verizon origins of this particular phone. There were no hitches in popping in the AT&T sim card, but the voicemail function has been a pain. AT&T had to make some changes in my account on their end, and I've yet to get the one-button direct call to voicemail to work. I have to call my own number and go through the prompts. It's not a huge deal, but it would be nice if it were more convenient.Read full review...",4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,You get what you pay for.,"Have had this phone for almost a month. I guess one can't complain too much about the image burn since it's stated in the product description. Just be warned that it is definitely noticable. Like a lot. I can clearly read what's been burned onto the screen. Everything else works fine. Battery could last a little better, but I'm not sure if it's cuz it's a used phone or if that's just how the battery is on this model of phones.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Excellent condition, but the language",The phone works great! No cracks or anything like that. everything works great how it‚Äôs supposed to.The only complaint that I have is changing the language to Spanish. Now it‚Äôs not big of an issue for most who speak English since that is the default language. But for those who can only speak Spanish it‚Äôs a bigger issue. When I try to change the language to Spanish it only changes in some places. And Spanish is also not available in the Samsung Keyboard.Read full review...,4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great Phone,"Coming from an Apple Phone, I couldn't be happier after I made the switch. Interface is user friendly, fast, responsive, wide& beautiful screen.The downside is the battery life, but I can't put the blame on it since my bluetooth is always on& always texting someone.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Solid Phone for the Price,"The phone is like new despite one minor issue. The volume buttons dont have a distinct click when pressed. Normally wouldn't care but under certain background colors, the screen makes a small glitch when the volume key is pressed. Again, minor, and it doesn't affect any if the working parts elsewhere. Also the top half of the screen looks as if a the previous owner imprint a page on the LED screen. Its only noticeable on white backdrops. And all it is is very faint lines running vertically on the top half of the screen. Again, very minor and doesn't affect any work mechanics.Read full review...",4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Good value for a streamlined phone,"It is more streamlined and faster than my previous smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy S5.  The only complaint I have so far is that the fingerprint ID does not work most of the time.  It says to make sure your finger covers the entire sensor area.  I am doing that but it does not recognize my fingerprint.  The face recognition works a little better, as long as you don't have your face too close to the phone.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,I'm happy with the phone,"The only gripe I have is I was expecting the phone to be black because that's what the descriptor said, but it's silver. I really don't care for the silver but eh.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Good phone but a little inconvinience,"Very nice phone and almost every promise was met up with. The only problem was that the charger that came with the phone isn't a fast charger. For the first week I had it it did say ""fast charging"" when I plugged it in but after that it said ""slow charging"" I mixed and matched and figured out that it was the cable that was the problem. I used an lg fast charger and it seemed to work. A little inconvinience but not that much of an issue because I ordered a samsung fast chargerRead full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,This phone does all I need and more.,"I really like this phone! I was hesitant as I have had 2 of the s series that totally failed me. I rely on my phone 24/7 for work, so battery stability is essential. And using the stylus to make notes on the fly is a major bonus- no more hunting for paper and pen, I have had the phone for 3or 4 months now and it has not slowed down in the slightest. Oh yes and I take pictures for my job as well and they are almost idiot (me) proof! They come out great and crisp and clear. Did I say that I really like this phone?Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Lightweight, best in this price!","This product looks like new, I have been using it for the last couple of days it it feels simply great. The camera quality is top class, however low light photos are a little bit noisy. But I think that's pretty normal for any phone. I am a camera and video person, so I found the extra memory card slot very helpful. I am enjoying my journey with Samsung S10E so far.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,The perfect size phone?,"Really like the size, not too wide like my last phone. My only complaint about the phone itself is the lack of a notification LED or an equivalent alternative (persistent blinking light) program built in. Tried some 3rd party apps but they have all let me down. Not a huge deal, just wish Samsung would have bothered with a virtual replacement that doesn't stop going off so it can catch my eye without having to inspect my phone. Definitely get a case for this phone because it's slick.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Unlocked AT&T version,"It wasn't clear to me when I bought it, but this phone was intended to be an AT&T phone. It shows their logo during power up, it has several of their apps preloaded, and includes some of their phone features.Regardless, it was a new sealed unlocked phone, and I had no problems getting it working with my no-name cell carrier.There is other bloatware preloaded as well as the AT&T apps, but I was able to disable most of it.The phone itself is great. Smaller than I am used to, but very full featured, at a great price.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great phone!,"So far I love the s10e! Coming from an s7 active, it's faster and I get about a full day out of the battery with moderate use.

I spent a good amount of time researching my next phone and I'm glad I finally got this one.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,The Samsung Galaxy S10e is a great phone!,"It's really about the same size, possibly smaller than the S5 that we enjoyed for about 5 years. But because the screen fills the whole front, it seems bigger... and much much faster, lots more room. The S5 16gs, this S10e 125. Plus 512 with the card. Awesome!. Plus a great camera.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Full Featured, Easy to Carry","Very easy to carry and fast (upgraded from S8 Active). I've read some reviews that state that the battery doesn't last. My battery lasts all day, and I have CGM software running continuously in the background.One complaint- I do not like the slippery glass feel that all new phones seem to have, so I bought a case. The S8 Active felt very secure in the hand.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Nice compact phone,"Upgraded to this to replace Sony Xperia X Compact. I wanted something *slightly* bigger, but could still comfortably be operated with one hand, and this fits the bill with the help of my stick-on card holder with strap. One UI is definitely better than TouchWiz, and adds an extra layer of sheen and polish to stock Android. What's further, the device updated incrementally (across a few updates) to Android 10 without any trouble. The 1080p screen is beautiful, the camera's nice. My microSD and microSIM went in and worked without any trouble. Battery lasts surprisingly long; at present I can get two days and change with one charge. I haven't had the opportunity yet to flex its impressive tech specs, but the 6GB of RAM I saw was a 2x upgrade over the Xperia X Compact so I feel confident in it.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Good little phone-LOTS of onboard memory,Smaller format phone makes it easier to put in pockets.  Battery life isn't as great as I'd hoped.  Onboard memory is ample at 128 gigs...don't really need a sd card but this is one of the few that are still able to accept one.  Has lots of bells and whistles for the camera.Read full review...,4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Very decent phone,"I had a specific criteria in mind when looking to upgrade my Samsung S7.  The S10e provides the same form factor, slightly larger battery size, expandable SD memory, and is even a little lighter. The same processor is used in this phone as the S10.Since I am on the Sprint network, I will not have to upgrade my phone to take advantage of the additional frequencies provided by the T-Mobile merger. Overall, this is a very decent phone and meets my needs.  The only recommendation I have is, when activating the phone, obtain the IMEI numbers directly from the phone since the box it comes in my not reflect the original product. Granted, this is an open box product and the phone was in new condition but had been previously activated on Verizon's network.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Great Phone, Great Price","For the price that I paid, $339, unlocked from factory, this phone is so awesome that it's hard to believe.  When I bought the phone I got a $50 Wikibuy rebate that I don't know how it worked but it came out to $339.  I don't like big phones and my Moto G5+ was beginning to show its' age so I started looking for a new phone.  The S10e is actually physically a little smaller but the screen size is somewhat larger.  For me, this is perfect.  So far, I have absolutely no complaints about this phone.  Sometimes it doesn't recognize my face or my fingerprint but then it is just easy to enter my code, (a lot less recognition issues as compared to the G5+).  Charging without plugging in every day is great.  The camera is great too but I'm not very particular about the camera in general.  Phone has everything that I want or need at an extremely reasonable price.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great Value for $400,"Works like a charm, has all of the features of the S10 that I cared about in a smaller form factor with a better price. If you can get it for a discount, then it's still a great value in 2020.",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great phone!,"It's a great phone. The battery doesn't last quite as long as my old note 8, but it's totally worth it as a trade for the smaller size.",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,The perfect phone for me.,Phone looked and functions like new at half the price. It was an open box purchase. Transferring data from my old Samsung was a breeze.

I do like the headphone jack, expandable memory, Snapdragon 855 chip (plenty fast), and the lightness of the phone (30 grams lighter than the iPhone 11 Pro).Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great phone!,"My husband loves this phone!  It was bought to replace his ruined S8.  We originally contemplated a used S9, but our son convinced us we didn't want to go two generations back, as updates would become less frequent.  As my husband has a tendency to drop phones, we did much research on both the screen protector (LK tempered glass), and case (Speck presidio grip).  They were both highly reviewed and fit the phone perfectly.Fingerprint reader on the side works great with his thumb.  The camera is great quality.  The phone looked like new when received.  The charging cables that came with the phone didn't work well, but we were able to find better options in our stash of charging sets. Very pleased with the purchase!Read full review...",5

Perfect business phone.I'm super happy with it and can't stand how new phones are so expensive.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,solid phone .. which operates smoothly and flawlessly.,"This S10E is as expected--terrific.   Of course it's a great phone, especially withe the great price. However, I can't give it 5 stars because of all the bloatware. And most of it is baked in and can't be uninstalled.  Some can't even be disabled.  But again, all in all it's an awesome phone.BTW, I was ready to follow the crowd and forget about Bixby. However, I'm glad I didn't. It's not just a live information port, but you can set up soo many routines through Bixby. It's really a valuable function and I encourage people to investigate.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Really great deal.,"This purchase was much better than I expected.  It has long battery life, great graphics, fast and easy to use.  However, you need to spend some time learning the new features. Just one word of caution; the screen edge can crack easily if you are not careful (it got a small crack after one week), even with a hard case. I made the mistake of not getting a ""gorilla glass"" screen cover for it. Don't make the same mistake I did.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Product Review,Pretty good condition. Battery health was 85% when first received. Had a few minor scratches on the top of the screen. Came with a regular charging plug (not fast charging) and a cheap short USB c cable.Read full review...,3
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Good Phone, nice size, like the additional micro SD option.","I like it so far.   Some getting used to with new features even though I have had a few Samsung  Galaxy.  It's fast.  The only reason for the 4 star at this time, is that I bought this phone under the ""NEW Other"" category, and I think the battery goes down a little faster than I expected from a ""NEW"" phone.   It could be my screen illumination level, but I made sure it is at most 50% scale.  It goes down 5% in 5+ minutes watching live video.   Lot of storage, especially with the micro-SD card that I can insert.  Size: just a bit longer than the S6 Edge.Read full review...",4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Grade upgrade from s5,I really like the S9+. I bought this phone to replace my s5. The pictures are wonderful. I like several of the upgrades and look forward to exploring more of this phone. I like the layout and the fact that it was factory unlocked so I didn't have as many unnecessary apps hogging my memory. I would recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't want to pay for a 10 but wants to upgrade.Read full review...,5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Can't get more for the price. Galaxy is a galaxy.,Priced as an average used phone; looks new. I don't know what a form factor is but this is a plus size phone. Used all day on 10% of the battery.,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Absolutely perfect,Couldnt be happier with my purchase. Everything is exactly as it should be. I've never purchased a phone from ebay so I was very cautious with this purchase but did it anyways. The phone is flawless and had only one issue. The battery charge icon on the phone pops on and off when I charge it at night. I don't know if it's a bug or what but it doesnt really affect me just the star rating.Read full review...,4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,LOVE this phone,"Very pleased and impressed with this phone. I love it, pure and simple. The screen is nice and large, yet the device is slim enough to fit easily in a middling-to-deep pocket. In hand it feels like it's all one piece - the construction is that seamless. And, hey, it's got the looks.But what's inside matters more, and functionally this phone leaves little room for complaint. The Android 8 OS is fast and well-implemented with plenty of RAM to drive it, and that big, beautiful OLED screen is rich and responsive. This is the first phone I've owned that I thought fully merited the smart label. I haven't run into a single glitch in the three weeks I've owned mine, and I've used it for hours every day. Battery life is great; menus are simple; apps and features are practical and intuitive; and customization is a snap.Both the front and rear cameras are super. Selfies contain plenty of detail, and I like having the wide angle and optical zoom versatility of the two rear cameras. Low-light capability is incredible for the sensor size, and images are free of motion-blur in all but the worst lighting. 4K videos are also impressive, and built-in stabilization works well. Video playback is top-notch, thanks to the gorgeous 6.2-inch display.Call clarity and volume are excellent.Bluetooth setup is a snap; connected to my headphones or speakers, media sound is impressive and readily customized.If I were to deduct a star from my rating, which I'm not, it would be for the following reasons.a) Depending on the country where the phone is manufactured, the international version may have European English spelling and date formats rather the standard US ones. This can't be changed in settings. However, one of the updates that installed after I initialized my phone added the option for a US English on-screen keyboard. Thanks to that, auto-correct doesn't constantly change everything I type from the US spelling. Also, if you choose to show it on the home or lock screen, the date appears with the day before the month and year. Not an issue for me, but everyone is different, so I'm pointing it out.b) With the international version, there's no US warranty. However, you can purchase independent coverage and also register your phone at the website for its country of origin. c) It‚Äôs slippery. The phone is entirely clad in glass. While it rocks the looks, this also makes the phone way easy to drop. And you know what happens when glass hits a hard surface. A good case is necessary, but with one installed, the phone loses some of its aesthetic appeal. Also, to avoid interference with the phone's edge function, any case or portfolio on the market will have low rims along the sides - not enough coverage or cushion for real protection. For that you'll need a screen protector.Speaking of which, there are many buyers complaining about both the film and tempered-glass screen shields available for this phone. Myself included. I purchased three other screens before stumbling onto one that doesn't pop off or interfere with touch response. The screen is expensive, and installation involves a tedious application of liquid adhesive. It's in a class by itself, though, and definitely worth the cost. Just search a screen protector kit with liquid adhesive and UV lamp.d) The built-in speakers are kind of wimpy, and with speaker phone enabled, there's some slight fuzziness. None of these points is enough to detract from the phone's usefulness or desirability. Its current slot as the No. 1 Android phone of 2018 is well-deserved. All in all, a good-looking, feature-rich and user-friendly device that's positively brilliant in operation. I cannot recommend it highly enough.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great Phone. Great Price üëç,"Love this phone. Product came in mint condition except was a small scratch on screen that you can't even see when phone is on.Coming from a pixel 2 XL the gesture navigation is not very intuitive or good at all. However camera seems great.The only real downside I see is that the phone takes a long time to charge even when set to ""fast charging"" . And yes I am using a high-wattage power delivery charger. Still the phone only charges 8% every 2 minutes on average. My pixel 2 charge a percent a minute on average. So this phone takes twice as long to charge which is why I removed a star and did not give it a full 5.Overall a great phone for the price and I would highly recommend.Read full review...",4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great phone,"When I ordered this phone I thought I was ordering int e Samsung Galaxy S9; it wasn't until after I placed the order that I realized that I ordered the S9+, so I was getting a better deal than I thought I was. My only complaint about the phone is that while it is unlocked it is associated with T-Mobile and there are a few T-Mobile apps I cannot uninstall. I am an AT&T customer, so that annoys me, however, I haven't really noticed any performance issues because of it. Once I realized this was the S9+ I expected this amazing battery life, and I haven't really seen that. It doesn't seem any better or worse than my old Samsung Galaxy S8.Read full review...",4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus,"Wow!  ok, so I've been a devoted iPhone user for many years.  Today, I decided to give android a try in buying my first Samsung cell phone. I must say I was a bit overwhelmed when I unboxed and fired the S9 plus up for the first time.  I've now been with this phone for all of 24 hours and am having the time of my life setting it up. So so many features like I've never seen before, certainly not on any of my iPhones.So, in this short time with this phone i must say it's a fantastic piece of workmanship. I works flawlessly and the speed at which it operates is unbelievable. Every feature has a purpose and works wonderfully.  The fingerprint reader is smooth and extremely fast.  I haven't yet set up the retina scan or face recognition, but intend on getting to it soon.  The camera is nothing short of amazing. Its shoots regular as well as portraits that are of a quality of a DSLR.   The video camera is additionally crazy good. From regular all the way up to 4k.  There is nothing that this camera / video camera can't handle.I could go on and on about this phone and its quality.  Its feature rich to say the least.Watching a movie on this phone is a genuine pleasure.   Hope this helps.Now, go and give one a test run.Read full review...",5

Nice!Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Best bang for your buck; Near factory new.,"Phone came in near mint condition with only a few tiny scratches that are non visible unless you hold it to a light.  Phone functions as if factory new, came in completely clean and reset.  Also came with a fast charging cable which was a very nice addition.  The battery appears to be new, as it lasts hours when playing games like Pokemon Go or emulating various platforms.  For the price sold, (at the time of purchase it was 290 for the cobalt variant) I don't think there's really a better option.  I was careful about buying refurbished, but this might be one of the best purchases I've made in a long time.  Extremely satisfied and happy with my like-new Samsung Galaxy S9+.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Arguably the best personal device on the market.,"The Samsung Galaxy S10 is without a doubt the finest communication device I have ever owned. Personal communication device is a better name than smartphone. Everything about this is superior to what I have had in the past. Spending a month with this device confirms to me that unless Apple developed something truly earth shattering, something incredible like live transparent 3D floating display in mid air over the face of the display, something out of a Sci-fi movie, I would not buy anything they made. The S10 is the perfect form factor, not too small (iPhone 8) not too big  (S10+) The expandable memory is where it is at, I immediately got a 512Gb card. The freedom of having half a terabyte in your phone is liberating. I can shoot movies, I can take any picture, (the camera is awesome by the way) and after a month I haven't even scratched the surface of the available memory. The screen is gorgeous, the facial recognition security is very cool. the fingerprint scanner in the screen is awesome. Tactile response is smooth and fast. The features are deep and it is a powerful piece of hardware. I plan to own this phone for 5+ years so I got the best one, and I really do believe it will handle all my needs moving forward. Great product and smart and a whip!Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Mine was a CDMA and not a GSM,"I's a great phone but I had a hard time getting it properly activated. It was an unlocked phone advertised as a GSM ATT or T-Mobile phone. The ATT sim that Straight Talk sent didn't work properly in this phone. The Straight Talk tech that was helping me troubleshoot the problem, after checking the IMEI, said that the phone was instead a CDMA type phone. Long story short, I bought another sim from Walmart and after MUCH YouTube searching for proper APN settings was able to get it to work with a Verizon sim card. Straight Talk was no help over the phone and didn't even bring up APN settings. I had to create and add an APN profile because the phone didn't have one, and would not update automatically.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,More power in a small package,The Samsung S10 is a powerful Android phone . A slim compact smartphone. The security settings are great ; use your fingerprint or your face to unlock the phone.If you have a Google account it is easy to transfer most of your Google apps and settings .There is an adapter included to transfer data from your old phone to your new Samsung Galaxy S10 .The battery seems to last most of the day but I use this phone constantly and may have to give it a boost towards the end of the day . The wireless charging is a good feature ; just place the phone on the wireless charging station (sold separately) to boost the battery or to get a full charge .The 128GB internal storage is massive and an SD card can be added for more storage if needed .The curved edge glass is unique and takes a little to get used too .No need for a screen protector because Samsung installs one at the factory.There are several features that are productive and useful .The phone is unlocked and does not have a sim card included . Just transfer your existing sim card from your old phone to this new phone . Power up and you are ready to go.I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S10 .Read full review...,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great phone !,"Had a Samsung Galaxy S5 for years.  Had several batteries around to ensure I was never without communications.  Was time to upgrade due to application that no longer worked on the S5.  Was hesitant to purchase a phone that did not have replaceable battery.   Looked at the apple, and other brand phones but decided to stick with Samsung because of familiarity.  I am exceptionally surprised by the battery life of the S10 and how much more responsive it is.  It also takes exceptional pictures.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great Screen and Long Lasting Battery!,Great New Phone! Purchased this to replace my Samsung Galaxy S8 which was still in good working condition although I could tell the battery was losing a bit of it's life.  Have wanted to move up to the S10 for some time and this was priced so competitively I couldn't resist (and I'll have the S8 as a backup if need be).  Love the larger full screen and the added features that come with the S10 as well as the updated camera!  All in all very pleased.Read full review...,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Love this phone - update: camera malfunction,I looove it!! It's a tiny crack on the back that my phone case covers anyway! The phone works like brand new and im in love with it. I've been waiting months for the s10 lite to have a price decrease and now I found this s10 for an even lower price. I'm super happy thank you.UPDATE: after a few days I noticed the camera has some weird glitch. I was on video with someone and they saw my image flashing green and glitching. So something is wrong with the cameraRead full review...,4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Samsung s10 was a good choice/move from my S5, Smart phones are great although their size is an unavoidable consequence for active working men if you want the technology.  A quality protective case is a must unless you have deep pockets to replace broken phones regularly.  Mine hit the floor within 3 days but survived.  I had no desire to change my carrier plan and did not want to be forced into monthly payments.  Buying outright was my preference.Read full review...,5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,The S10 is totally worth every penny!,"Bumping up from the S7 was necessary given the lack of memory in the S7.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,S8 Review,"It's a great product, a nice tech step up from the S7 which I almost bought. Had an S5 for years, didn't really need all the bells and whistles on a new $$$ S9-S10.  Comes stock with 64MB memory and a faster processor, software about the same as the S7..  Like the smaller form factor, fits the hand and pockets better.  The curved edges are nice, but different.  Harder to fit a silicone cover on as the tabs only come over the corners, so it slips out of the cover easily.  Look for a good cover as the glass does protrude out.If I bought another S8, I would probably buy the S8 Active.  The S8+ does have a bigger screen bu 1/2 inch, not that much difference in the screen size. S8A is ruggedized, will survive rough handling and drops a lot better.  Doesn't need a glass cover with the extra layer of protection built in. Although It's several ounces heavier, pushing 8 oz, with the added frame but has a bigger, longer life 4000 mah battery.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Top heavy due to  It's  Size,"I am 6' 3 and have big hands, yet I have difficulty using it  with just one hand,  Like I did my S7 edge.Other than that, it has great  features. I like its nice display and plenty fast!",4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Close, but not ""Near Mint""","The title stated near mint. The phone screen would qualify as near mint, but the back would not. There was a significant scuff near the bottom of the rear of the phone. I have it in a cover that obscures it, but the entire aesthetic of the phone would not qualify as near mint. Otherwise, it works like it should and the battery life is good. All in all, I'm satisfied but did knock off a star for the inaccurate description.Read full review...",4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Skeptical but sold on it now,"I must admit I was a bit nervous about buying a phone on ebay. Especially an expensive one. But after receiving my Galaxy S8+ (earlier than expected). I've been completely satisfied with it. Something to note, if you are buying this phone (unlocked) to replace another, but still with the service (Verizon in my case). It turns out to be a very simple process of just swapping out the Sim card. I went from a Galaxy S4 to this phone. So the Sim card on the S4 was a ""micro"" sim. This meant that I had to cut the sim card down to a ""Nano"" Sim. I know this might sound intimidating, but it's not. Just google sim templates and you will find a lot of sources for how to do this. Be careful when you print out the template that you make sure you print it at full scale. Otherwise you will end up cutting the Sim card too small to work. To cut the sim card use very sharp kitchen scissors or big nail clippers with a straight edge (don't use clippers with curved edge).Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,It‚Äôs a great phone.,"The phones is great. Better than the iPhones in my opinion, for its no compromises design including a headphone jack over none on an iPhone. The phone is fast and able to play the latest games and is huge extra wide screen allows you to experience movies as well in HDR. One of the best phones of all time in the history of phones. One drawback that this phone has is that the single mono speaker it has is average at best when it comes to ringtones and audio playback. Another drawback is that I have found the screen of the phone, while very good quality with low reflectivity, scratches easily, so I recommend getting a screen protector to prevent it getting scratched. Another drawback, which is kind of a carrier limitation, is that some software features like he voice or volte are hidden or not enabled when you have this phone with software running from a different carrier and you are on service with one of the companies not under Samsung‚Äôs BYOD program.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great Value for My Needs,"Great deal on an ""old"" version of the phone. I replaced a Samsung S5 with the S9 Plus and couldn't be happier. I upgraded just because I couldn't download a travel app because the S5 didn't conform to its needs, so the app balked. No trouble with that app once I upgraded to the S9 Plus.I bought the US Cellular version and my carrier was able to activate it without any issues. Have to get used to swiping up/down instead of side to side for some things, but that is a minor nuisance. Takes great pictures and the battery lasts far longer than my old phone. It has a larger screen than my old phone which is great for my older eyes. Also like that this version uses a cable that doesn't have a ""right side up"" for charging.I'm not a ""power"" user, so don't need the expensive latest version of the Galaxy, so this was a great value for my needs.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Don't Leave a Note,"The Note 7 was perhaps the best Note of the series, but never stood a chance against a flood of media outrage over a small number of battery defects. The Note 8 is much like a Note 7.5 in how and when it was released. Among new features is the ability to hover over text with the S-Pen and use translate. This is an indispensable feature for anyone that plays foreign games or deals with a lot of foreign text and does not want a gallery of screenshots.The Note 8 may not be the solid aluminum frame of older Note devices, such as the Note 4, but it still feels sturdy. The screen is not as remarkably large compared to the S series counterpart, but creates a better viewing experience for movies or two simultaneous apps with a taller screen.When properly configured, the battery can last at least a full day and night or more. This device competes with the newest of the Note series by properly optimizing the software. Games run much longer at a nearly unnoticeable cost to the quality of the image. The sound quality is hard to differentiate from newer Samsung devices with Dolby Atmos, which makes that feature seem like an unnecessary name drop. Despite being focused on productivity, this is also a good gaming device.I used this device alongside an S10 Ultra and often found myself favoring it, despite forcing myself to assimilate to the newer device. This is a reliable phone and more than justifies the current cost for anyone that is not interesting in the newest technology.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Very Happy with my purchase,"Wanted bigger phone for easier texting on bigger keyboard layout and it is just the perfect size now.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Screen blemish is acceptable, good overall value for a slight compromise","Screen blemish is acceptable, good overall value for a slight compromiseunlike other sellers that also have blemishes on the screen, some of the sellers also state that as well as a blemish, their phone has dings, dents and scratches, and they want about the same or more for their phones.The phone I received was literally as good as new, besides the slight blemish on the edge of the screen, while noticeable, it does not affect the function in any way, and is completely unnoticeable except in bright white pages, which is actually quite rare, even when watching video content, because it is dark in nature and on the edge of the screen, it is very rarely noticeable...Good value for someone on a budget wanting a flagship phone for a fraction of the price! Thank you for the good valueRead full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Note 9 Best available, good but not great","Since most people can easily look up Note 9 features and specs, I won't go into that.This is a very good phone but due to industry trends, I have several disappointments but I don't think there is a better phone for me - this is the best available phone as of July 2020 (better than Note 10).Pros     S-Pen is awesome (I don't think any other phones have this other than the Note series).     Big, clear screen with nice touch     Headphone jack (although would be better if on top, disappointing that these are becoming less typical)     SD card slot (a must for me)     USB-C (symmetric, nice to be able to plug in without looking). Qi works too.     Powerful hardware and sensors     Finger print reader is reliable (although it is on the back which can be a pain sometimes)     Voice and sound quality     Camera and camera featuresCons     Curved Glass              (this is my biggest disappointment, screen protector don't hold well).             (Images and text are distorted near edges of the screen)     Battery is not customer replaceable             (another industry issue, why can't they make some variations replaceable?)     Fragile without a decent case and screen protector     Bixby button is useless and can't be re-assigned without a Samsung account.     Expensive (best to buy ""new"" on eBay which often means refurbished)     A bit heavyThere are lot more good and few more poor features but these are my big hitters. Hope you find a phone you like.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Beautiful with great features,"It's a great phone, was so easy to set up and I was able to use any carrier that I wanted. I  love the fingerprint sensor and face recognition, so much easier than using a pin or pattern.  I was expecting the instruction book with it, but this is the first time I've bought an open box phone. Not crazy about the Bixby button.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,screen and camera are excellent,"Battery life is incredible.  my old galaxy s5 battery would be completely used in days with heavy use. same use and the s 10 plus still has about 2/3rds remaining. my only complaint is the programs trying take over and the system settings are not as easy to work with as the s5 was.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Great battery, crispy and loud audio speakers, solid pictures and plenty of rugged case options.","I have been a die hard HTC guy for years so it made sense to switch to the Pixel 4 XL (picture quality, front facing speaker/audio clarity and massive rugged case options). I switched to S10+ last minute after watching a ""real review"" of pixel 4 by floss carter (youtube). I'm glad i did. Screen is significantly brighter especially outside (compared to pixel), same or better speaker/audio clarity, BETTER battery life, solid pictures (dont do social media so camera aint as important), double internal (128g) + expandable storage and MOST IMPORTANTLY plenty of options for rugged cases (Supcase, Poetic, etc).Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Very impressive features. Currently, best phone.","Great phone. Very impressive features. You can have 2 audio sources less one person plugged into headphones and maybe another person connected with bluetooth headphones and both people can be listening to different music. S-Pen is super useful. I like being able to draw a box around some text, even if text is actually part of a graphic image, then have the OCR convert it to real text and place it on the clipboard for easy pasting into another app. Easy to use 2 apps at once in window/split screen mode due to the very large display. Makes me way more productive. Connect a USB-C to HDMI cable and it goes into Dex mode and acts like a real computer with real desktop experience just like Microsoft Windows. Plus, can still use the phone as a phone while it's also acting like a real computer attached to TV or computer monitor. Or use the phone itself as the touchpad mouse and keyboard. That's really impressive. So much more. Currently, the best, most powerful phone out there. But probably not for too much longer (at least until the Note 10). I would give this phone 10 stars if I could. Nice long battery life too with it's 4000 mA battery. Can go days without charging if I wanted to. Beautiful screen, great camera, so much greatness in one device. Looking forward to Android Pie and Samsung UI One on it for even more features, which should be getting the update any day now (hopefully).Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Arrived damaged, wasn't new as stated, and in damaged box","My $500 ""new"" phone arrived damaged. When I opened the shipping bag I knew I was in trouble, who ships such a fragile device in an unprotected bag!? Long and behold the phone box was damaged when I took it out. It was along one side so i figured maybe the phone would be fine, upon inspection i discovered this phone is NOT NEW. They sell it claiming it is new but it 100% isn't. The Phone had small cracks along the bottom of the device showing bad wear, the speaker vent had gunk and debris from use and wear. Despite having the protecting lament on the device it was covered in hand prints. Read full review...",1
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Nice phone, excellent condition","SO far, so good.I've had the phone for all of about 2 hours and I was immediately impressed with the fact that it was A)brand new in original box and B) connected to the T-Mobile network without an issue.I updated it and went through installing my apps without issue.Phone is very impressive.Pros:Perfect size for my large handsFastPerfect conditionAndroid 9 preinstalledWireless ChargingHEADPHONE JACK!Cons:1 item of note here; there seems to be a slight problem with the touchscreen in the lower left corner of the screen not receiving my finger input on the first try.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Amazing battery life, Screen, Speed, and Light/Thin. Night photos A+","Absolutly Wonderful.  I upgraded from a Note 4 with a 10,000Mah ZeroLemon battery.  I loved the phone, it was brick/Tank.  and really wasn't ready to upgrade.  But the Note 4 was slowing down a lot.  Even after multiple Factory resets and all, it seemed like the phone updates caused the phone to be almost unusable.  My whole family of 4 all had the same issues same Note 4.  So we all bought new Note 9 Phones and got Unlocked versions so we can use them in Alaska with native carriers during our future vacation.  I didnt have alot of hope that the note 9 with a Small 4,000Mah battery would be able to get me thru the day. Using it for Music, 5 emails, eBay (Buying and Selling), Consistent Picture taking, and even a Bar-code scanner that i use for product scanning.  Well to my surprise the frist few weeks i always had 40% left .  While i have had it for quite a while i now play games on it, as its fun and so fast for games.  The battery JUST makes it thru out the entire day with out charging.  I think i will add a battery case to it in the future.  But im absolute happy with my phone purchase.The bigest difference was Battery life, weight, form factor, speed.  I was expecting more out of the camera, such as a wider camera view.  But i will say the note 9 camera Does AMAZING at night time or lightly lite rooms.  Takes amazing pictures there.  The selfie camera is also better.Read full review...",5

The price for a good, used Note 9 - which is even better than it was new thanks to Android updates.The Note 9 is not a small phone, which is great because it has a beautiful, big, highly-legible screen.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Business Phone,"Great battery life, nice camera, awesome amoled screen. Whats not to like about it.",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Preferred to be thinner,Galaxy Note 9 is a good product but not ease of use.,4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great Phone with Long Battery Life,"First of all, I love this phone. It's the perfect size and easy to use. After having a phone that had a dead battery within a few hours, having one that lasts a day and half is wonderful. My only complaint so far is that I am unable to set up different text tones from ringtones like my Samsung Galaxy S5 did. I prefer a different text tone from different people, especially for work, so I know if I need to check it asap or not. Plus it's cute and I like cute. If it wasn't for that this would definitely be a five star purchase.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Too bad battery life,"Most things works, but not the tilting-function and the battery life doesn't last a day. Can't leave home without power bank. And it can't take the cold. If it's fully charged when I fall asleep, it might be 50% when I wake up.The pop-up ads are really annoying.Camera and most functions are impressing.Read full review...",2
Cell Phones & Smartphones,great phone for the money,"So far so good!!  The phone looked brand new.  Not a scratch to be seen.  You never know exactly what you are going to get with these things, and this phone did not disappoint.  It has a large memory... a long battery life (I went three days after fully charging it after receiving it).  It seems to have a pretty good camera too.  It's a little big, but for me, that was just fine.  My last one broke because of it getting dropped too many times... I'm hoping having a little bit of a bigger one will help that (more to hold onto)  :)   I like having the options for signing into accounts and the phone (eye scan, fingerprint, password, etc).. my other phone didn't offer those things.  I have to get used to the screen always being 'on' as it always displays the time, day, and date, and battery power as well.  I thought at first I wouldn't like that, but I've gotten used to it.  I believe you can turn that off though if you'd like.  Overall... so far a great phone.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Fast, great screen...and goodbye battery anxiety.","I've always said I wanted a phone that was a tad thicker and had a bigger battery and the S8 Active is perfect.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"New conditon, nice size lots of features",New condition.  Good size for my small hands.  Nice color.  I'm a purple fan.

Cons are probably that it isn't that simple to figure out how to use some of the technology available.Read full review...,4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Galaxy S8,"Absolutely in love with this phone! Camera is great, screen is beautiful, phone size isn't too big nor too small.

I'm really glad that I decided to make this purchase!Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Works great with T-Mobile,I bought this S8 phone to enable use of T-Mobile features (wifi calling and voice over 4G) which were not functional with my older unlocked Galaxy S7.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,My Galaxy S8 rocks!!,"There are many well thought out design improvements to this S8 over previous Galaxy generations.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Smart buy,Honestly  the price. Also I love galaxy's and wanted a nicer camara.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Love it.,"Item arrived in a sealed original box with all accessories,  fantastic phone, even better price.",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,More issues than what was being offered,I would assume 4 out 5 stars would be atleast not having the water protection triggered so I can't use the c-port.  iso scrub did the trick. And a wipe cache.. And normal wear would not include a 2mm gash in the middle..Read full review...,2

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Compliments the product,"Thank you so much, I don‚Äôt have nothing to say right now because phone work so good",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Complicated, but powerful","First, I will share a few things that are really annoying about this phone. 1) You basically need to only call with a Bluetooth headset as the screen does not stay off during calls and you will inevitably dial numbers. 2) The Bixby routines lack things like WiFi disconnection as triggers. 3) Even with large hands, it is extremely easy to cover the speaker or the microphone while holding the phone. 4) You have to be careful about USB C accessories as generic audio dongles do not work and legacy USB adapters do not work if they are flipped.This is NOT a phone for someone who is uncomfortable with technology as I literally spent several hours in the settings even after importing from my Galaxy S7.Now for the things I like about this phone. 1) USB C enables a really cool DeX mode for using apps on a larger monitor. 2) Focus modes and Bixby routines help minimize distractions. 3) Lasts about 2 days with fairly heavy usage for me. 4) Samsung PayRead full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Excellent phone, but camera is so-so","Very fast processor. Responsive screen. Beautiful design. Perfect size. My only complaint is the camera.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,S20 Plus upgrade from a Note 9,"Great screen quality, very fast response on stock settings, smooth operation and great battery life for the size of the phone. Upgrading from a Note 9, overall performance and battery life are better. I miss having a 3.5mm headphone jack, as plugging in my headset isn't possible while the phone is charging. Samsung's touchwiz on the S20 Plus has a few tweaks and upgrades compared to the Note 9, and there are settings options for the S20 Plus that are absent from the Note 9. Overall I'm very happy with the upgrade. The S20 Plus is a solid phone with stunning graphics and powerful hardware balanced with great battery life.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Awesome Phone,I was a little scared to buy it. But I did it anyway. The phone is unlock. And I put metro PCS service on it. Its a great phone its like new. Have 2 scuffs on it. But with the case I can't even see it. If feels like a brand new phone. Read full review...,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Little difference from my Galaxy S8 in everyday usage.,"Pricy for little useful improvement over Galaxy S8.  Don't need 8K video. Loaded with extra apps that duplicate other apps. Strange USB C to USB C cable useful in one case only: transfer of data from old to new phone.  This worked well.  Otherwise it's useless, as is the USB C output from power supply.  Where's the ""5G""?  No sign of it around this 1 million person metro area.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Where's the manual?,"As a phone, the S20+ 5G is a fine device. Anyone who buys one should wait until it arrives before ordering any accessories - the included accessories are pretty good.As a software engineer with decades of experience with Windows I cringe when I use Android. IMO the basic design of the user interface is flawed, inconsistent. and often non-intuitive. It often assumes the user has knowledge a new or inexperienced user might not have. And there is no written manual! If you want to learn how to do something Google is your best bet.  I'm getting used to it, but it hasn't been easy.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,The better of the S20 series,"Is better in every way to my Note 10 Plus with one exception, the speaker quality. The volume is the same, but the speakers of the Note adds more body to the mids and is more pleasent. In every other aspect the S20 Plus shines, it feels good in the hand, the display is awesome with great color calibration (in natural mode), the 120hz is awesome, great performance, great design and very nice camera (some over sharpening, but pleasent colours and low noise in low light).Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great smartphone,"It's a great smartphone, the battery lasts me all day (I'm a heavy user, I watch a lot of videos and play games).

Cell Phones & Smartphones,There are always trade offs.,"In some ways the Samsung Galaxy S5 is as good or better than the S6. Although the S6 is a great phone, and it is really convenient to be able to charge the long life battery just by putting it on a charging disc instead of plugging it in,  you cannot put in an additional SD storage card, the back is sealed so you can't swap out batteries if you want like in the s5, and the S6 is not 3G....it is 4G and 2G. So if you want to buy cheap service that is 3G only, you cannot. The screen is also brighter than a S5, which is really great outside.So, the S6 is it great phone but if you're on a budget, buy a S5 instead, but not an S4-    because the battery life is too short in those.Finally, I love the software of the Samsung Galaxy S and would not have any other smartphone at this time....that includes iPhones.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Good replacement,"Shipped on time , arrive with a few more scratches than I expected along the edges, where  the earphone and charging dock are located ,  fast loading times on websites, fast query keyboard,  Battery life could be better , at 50% mid day after being charged fully over night.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Phone was in good shape w/few or no scratches. Disappointed in battery life,Phone seems to work well with much faster cpu & brighter screen than my old one.

Can't have cake and eat it too I guess.Read full review...,4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great Phone,Ever since my galaxy s3 i've stuck with Samsung. I love their phones. They do everything I want and have a great camera. Apple phones are ok but I'm not a douche bag or a small child so I stick with an adult phone. The only bad thing about this phone is that they took away the micro sd card slot on the s6 model but I heard they are bringing it back. Thats the only reason I didnt give it 5 stars.Read full review...,4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Samsung Galaxy 6s review,"I ordered this phone after using the iPhone 6s plus. I've also owned several other makes and models and have to say of all this phone takes the cake. While I was skeptical about the screen size I was pleasantly surprised at how perfect this one is. The colors are vibrant, it has a super fast processor, the camera takes clean crisp pictures for eBay use and is easy to use. I love this phone, hands down the best so far.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,older model Android but excellent value,"I've been using Android phones for about 10 years and prefer them over the Apple iPhone. This phone was a big improvement over the S5. It's not quite as nice as my S7, but it serves the bill for a phone for my wife who doesn't need many features. This phone seems brand new and works perfectly well and was a good value. Happy with this purchase. I read several reviews that said it had a short battery life. After I booted up the phone I noticed the battery was running down fairly quickly. But I went in and disabled a lot of the apps under App Manager. Including the ones that run in the background that I don't need that use up battery life. I also set the display not quite as bright. And now it's battery life is way better. So I'm not worried about it.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Those saying refurbished are not lying to you,"This phone was advertised as new in unopened box.I thought it was a great deal.It was far from it.I went online to find out of there was a way to see if your phone was a factory refurbished or brand new.There are many places to find this out within your phone.This was in fact refurbished.Fir a refurbished phone this is not a good deal.The battery burns literally twice as fast as a new.phone.That is unacceptable.The head phone Jack dodnt work properly either.Sounds was so low I couldnt hear anything.Do yourselves a favor-Check online to see if your phone is refurboshed,(It will be) then ask yourself why the phone is advertised as brand new in box.That's all you need to know right there.Ebay should not allow  this.Read full review...",1
Cell Phones & Smartphones,First Smartphone,"As this is my first Smartphone, I have nothing but my old clunky flip phone to compare it to.  This instrument is 5.5"" long and a bit over 2.5"" wide and less than 1/4"" thick which to me is a bit large but I am getting used to it.  I have seen much larger phones so this is not really a problem.  The phone works great once one figures out all the ins and outs.  A manual is a necessity.  The only problem I have with this phone is that it is extremely slippery and definitely requires a cover with some sort of rubber pads to hold on to.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"This is an older Samsung  phone, but it works great, and you can change the battery and add memory!","I've had other Note 4's since their release.

Otherwise phone looks new and works as it should, after 1 week.  Happy with purchase.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,No SD card?,"The new Galaxy S6 is ok.It is faster and slimmer than the S5, has better camera and all of that.However, it lacks in the following:- No external memory capability.- No removable battery.- No waterproofing.In my opinion these were what distinguish Galaxy from the rest. Now it's all the same, just better hardware in general.I still like Android better than iOS, that's the only reason I don't get an iPhone 6.Read full review...",3
Cell Phones & Smartphones,So far so good,The phone arrived several days after estimated delivery time but it arrived in very good condition. Looks practically new. I've had it activated for several days and seems to be working good. Battery life of phone is not very good. Not sure if it's due to bad battery or just all the Verizon bloatware pre-installed on phone.Read full review...,4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Quality Phone,"If you have used Samsung Galaxy in the past you already know what to expect. It is a quality phone that is easy to use and good size. I really like the fingerprint scanner, that is really great for using for security and unlocking the phone. Not too much to say about it, but if you have used Samsung in the past, no reason not to do this one as well.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Better security options,Having the thumbprint scanner allows for better security and faster access to sites that support it.  I've been able to use it with banking and credit card apps along with two factor applications.  Battery is good for what you can expect out of a smartphone; can make it two full days without really heavy usage.  Changing the battery in the S6 and above is now not as simple as it used to be.Read full review...,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Love it,"This is a beautiful phone, latest and greatest specs, the screen is like no other. Samsung Galaxy really stepped it up, the Galaxy s6 actually feels like a luxurious device in the hand with no plastic to be found with this model. Great ways to personalize this phone with the themes feature also. The best phone out there for many reasons!Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great device!,Had another galaxy s6 for years. Was going to get the new s8 but way to expensive for my needs. So I bought the s6 again. Really happy with it.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Handy phone but a battery burner.,"Having owned two Samsung Galaxy S5 phones, I figured this would be an improvement.  I wanted a new handset and could no longer find the S5 as new.  I like some of the new features, however i find myself charging it twice a day. I have read other reviews complaining about battery life issues. At this time I plan to download a diagnostic app to determine if the battery is defective. It does not help that the battery required a major operation to swap out.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Will work with Window 10 computer,I was a little hesitant to leave my old windows phone but this was the next best thing. It pairs to my windows 10 computer without problems that I have noticed.  Down side- It keeps trying to dock with my tv and I had to change some settings to keep it from automatically logging into facebook. I had to turn off some preloaded apps to keep ads from popping up. If you are a little tech savvy at all you can figure it out because I'm not! Battery life is pretty good but I run mine on battery saver mode most of the time. The battery is not interchangeable but I have a portable backup that solved that so I'm pretty happy. No problems docking to my headset and it also has earphone jack. Haven't had many problems using live streaming so far. Its one of the smaller smart phones that I have ran across if that is important to you.Read full review...,5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Lightweight with great features.,Easily fit into a pocket. Good.Will definitely need a memory card. Didn't find this need on the S3 and A5 neither.Cons:Battery drains very fast. Am retrieving as many apps as possible from the wallpaper.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,terrible,"good -phone size is perfect!bad -1- the signal was very poor, so could not make calls. (max call duration was 20 sec.)2 - battery drain in less than 7 hours with no action on phone, i guess due to poor signal and constant look up for signal.3 - sometimes phone becomes super hot, only shut down solves issue.I was very disappointed with the purchase.Read full review...",1
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great mini smartphone.,"Probably one of the best new android smartphones that fits in my small hands. The glass shattered easily from a 2' spill onto concrete out of my pocket. This is because the glass extends to the edge of the device rather than there being metal or a different material like the One mini or iPhone 4Batteries are easily swapped.Very powerful and responds quickly to voice commands.Keyboard will have a lot of errors in portrait mode because of the small size.Call quality is excellent, speakerphone is excellent.Speaker sounds okay but needs to be louder.Battery drains very fast when the headphones are used as an FM antenna.GPS can't always tell the difference between a frontage road and highway and also really suffers around tall buildings.Screen looks great but you can't see that much detail. As a plus you can zoom and pan in videos as they play.Pictures look amazing.Read full review...",4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Samsung S4 Mini,"Replaces an S4 I broke, I do like the smaller feel to it.  Needed some help with it so took it to my  AT&T store, they squared some things away & during the conversation they informed me this S4 was made for sale overseas.  Now I know why I cant read the instructions,  there in French.  Can download them from Samsung if needed.So far its is working great.  A nice surprise, bought a Screen protector but the other day, later  I felt something in the upper right of the screen, lo & behold I do believe it has a Screen protector & it does so I will take the one I bought back to the store for a refund.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great phone if you're looking for small form factor,"I want my phone to fit in my pocket and still be feature-rich, and this phone suits me perfectly.  The screen is not the stunning Samsung display, but it's a close second and still better than most - same for cameras.  Lots of extras with the Samsung Android skin.  Screen remains responsive with tempered glass protector.  Back was a little too slippery, so I cut-down and applied an old Zagg protector which worked perfectly.  Only drawback is the dated Android OS - mine has Jellybean (4.2) so I'll be sad when apps aren't developed for it.  Also note that the NFC is through the battery (it has the antenna).  I'm hoping that manufacturers start offering high-quality 4.3"" phones again; with the iPhone SE maybe things are coming around?Read full review...",4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,All around great phone! Front camera is just okay...,"Coming from an LG G4, this is a great phone. I had the S3 when it came out and the updates are crazy! Screen size is good, It's fast, lightweight, expandable memory, waterproof, SUPER fast charging (my phone fully charges in 1hr 15min or so with the samsung usb cable) etc... I don't have any complaints except for the front camera. I expected a better front camera on the S7.It's 5 megapixels but the camera makes you look cartoonish or painted with some sort of filter even WITHOUT beauty mode. It gives you this painted look without showing clear details which I find annoying. I googled this issue and it seems to be a popular disadvantage to the phone. Although I did find that it takes the best pictures outside or in well lit areas. My LG G4 had an 8 mp front camera that would blow this S7 out of the water. It's definitely not a terrible camera, but to be on the s7 they could've done so much better.Overall, the phone is impeccable. I highly recommend it, definitely worth every penny!(I recommend going to a phone store and playing around with the phone in person to see if its a fit for you before purchasing!)Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,A little worn but looks good otherwise,"Heads up, I am not a techie. The phone came with a charger cable. The cable port is worn and used looking. My phone cover hides the worn area. If that is the only thing I wrong with it then I guess that will be alright. I could have paid another $20 for an official new phone. If I can get 18- 24 months out of it then I will be happy. I hope it lasts that long for what I paid. It has required a few updates that didn't succeed at first but it seems to be working and updating now. This phone requires a NANO Sim card to use it for calls and texting. I wasn't even aware there was a Nano SIM. Make sure you order or buy yours in advance so you won't experience a set up delay. Upon activating the SIM with Page Plus, I noticed this S7 does not have the same signal strength as my previous S5. I live in a rural area and it seems like its a struggle to get 2 bars even while outside in a clear area. I used to get 3 bars on a good day with the S5. I do not care for the way you insert your SIM and Memory card into the S7 model. You have to use a little key,which will be difficult to keep up with, in order to access the tray inside the phone.  You cannot access the battery if you should need it. While its great to not have to keep a spare battery around it means you have to rely on the life on one which we all know lose their ability to charge over time. I am sure the phone has a lot more features that I will enjoy once I figure them out.Read full review...",3
Cell Phones & Smartphones,A good phone with good upgrades.,"The major issue with the Samsung Galaxy S5 was the battery life and that has been improved.  It now goes into a kind of sleeper mode when the screen is off.  It also has built in power saver modes.  The camera is excellent and so are the graphics.  The screen resolution is slimly different than the S5 ( I just ignore the S6 because all they changed was the camera).  It's an excellent phone with good accessories and features.  32 GB of internal memory and space to expand it with an SD card.  If you have an S5, you will need a new sim card as this one uses a different size.  I give it 4/5.  Battery Life is better, but can still be improved.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Everything's great except for bloatware and battery life,#NAME?,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Step up in technology for a more reasonable price than what Verizon wanred,coming from a Note 4 to the S 7 is a significant improvement. Mostly it seems in availability to readily accept software up-dates. Android is still Android but the location of many of the functions is  different and am still learning where they are located. Many numbers are now noted as spam & automatically blocked. Audio is good & calls go thru quickly. Software to transfer data was easy & worked as expected. Default language was Pacific Rim & couldn't reset to English till Verizon rep installed Sim card. Can't beat the price.Read full review...,4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Good Product,"The S7 is exactly the same size as the S5, but has double the internal memory (32gb) and double the RAM. I put a 200gb micro SD card in it, so I have more storage that I will probably every need. It comes with Android 6.0.1.  I am very happy with the phone.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great phone...but the free screen protector...,"I love this phone...i needed to upgrade from the S5 because i had no phone memory for my apps....even after moving all i could to my SD card.  anyway, the display on this phone is spectacular.  It is easy to use with little change from the S5...marshmallow still has some annoying quirks like not notifying when you have message app open.  good battery life and i absolutely LOVE the wireless charging...no more plugging in the stupid cords.  the free tempered glass screen protector that came with this is useless, i had to throw it away.  it doesn't go all the way to the edges of the display because of the slightly curved edges.  i understand the difficulties of making a glass protector of this nature and i should have read the reviews about them, but i did not realize that the S7 regular had the slightly curved edges.  great phone...love samsung.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Past gen galaxy still better than today's iphone,"I'm coming from a Windows lumia icon (929) and an iPhone 6 so I may be easy to impress.Performance: The phone is zippy and very responsive. Bloatware could use some trimming but it doesn't seem to affect it much outside of taking up your limited storage.Camera: the specs may look a bit less than stellar but the software behind the camera makes all the difference. It has a very crisp photo better in the dark than both my previous phones. It also gets the color right 98% of the time whivh is phenomenal. I consider this 12mp camera an upgrade from my lumia's 20mp.Stats: The weight and size are what I would consider ideal. (I'm an adult male who usually fits a large work glove size perfectly). It is slim and solid (No flex, no noises). I recommend a cheap case that protects the back (camera) and sides. The back is a smudge magnet but with a case it makes no dofference.Other notes: the antenna seems weaker than my lumia even though i have the same provider and same towers (could be my cheap case) It was a nightmare tryimg to get this on straighttalk but it eventually worked. The battery life is nothing more than acceptable and the microUSB is my least favorite option for a charge port but it accepts wireless charging and can charge 10-100% in 1.5 hours or less so that helps.Overall I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase. I still have some things my iPhone family doesn't have and, so far it has performed better than an iPhone 6 in every way except battery life.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Samsung S7,"Great Phone. The battery lasts long time, it takes great pictures, the features are great, and quality of calls clear. Durable, decent sound quality for music, and a lot of apps.",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,I like S7 much better then I liked my IPhone 7.,"Coming from the IPhone, which at this point is kind of a creepy walled garden where everything is Apple's way or the highway, I like the Android OS MUCH better.  Still some quirks and annoyances, but other ways to do things when you hit them, and not as many as on the IPhones, and the hardware seems much better all around.The Galaxy S7 has a little different strategy for power...  it's hard to tell for sure since this is still a new phone to me and is pulling lots of updates, but it does appear to be using the battery a bit faster.  However, it also charges the battery much faster.  In general I think this is a net gain, especially with decent sub $20 wireless charger pads all over ebay and amazon, and a simpler limitation to live with then a slower to discharge but slower to charge phone.  But there may be circumstances where it is a limitation.I also think this Samsung S7 is more honest about the battery.  When it says 30% left, there is 30% battery left.  When my IPhone said 30% left, it was time to panic, as it could drop to 0% in a heartbeat.  So the Samsung battery may last just as long, it just lies less then the IPhone and it will take me a few months to learn to trust after years of Apple lies and broken promises.Android also has far more rational security controls.  Apple has made a lot of changes designed to keep the FBI from being able to get into your phone, even with a warrant.  That's fine if you want it, but Apple has forced that default on everyone.  Android lets you have a more rational balance between invasive and painful security controls versus the value of your data. They leave room for a rational ""medium level security"" for ""medium level risk"".The one I got was ""overstock"" for about $235, and for that, this thing is an insanely good value at the moment.  It wasn't new in box, it came in a non factory box, so I don't think it was quite ""new old stock"" like advertised, but if there was any sign of use on it, I couldn't find it.  It was absolutely perfect.  I'll use it for a couple years as my main phone, then maybe retire it as a dedicated dashboard engine monitor or something, which I will be able to do because its a more open system that I I can only add or modify 'if it pleases the king' Apple.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Great deal, used battery","The phone out of the package was very appealing and looked new. The phone functions normally and was easy to set up. Everything about the phone feels new, other than the fact that the battery life is that of a used-up, years-old phone battery.My new S7 with new battery would last 1.5+ days on a full charge with average use, while this refurbished S7 dies just before a full 1 day of average use.I wish that refurbished phones all received new batteries, but you get what you pay for;m it functions well, and the price is great.Read full review...",4

It just came today and I don't have a SIM card for phone use yet but have been exploring it. I Upgraded from a Galaxy s3, which I was satisfied with, but when I thought I had lost the s3 I read about the s7 and decided I wanted one for the better camera and keyboard.  The keyboard has a row across the top with numbers - no more switching back and forth between alphabet and numbers when typing!!!The fingerprint recognition works great.  It feels great in my hand, but I don't have a case for it yet.Samsung has an app that made it easy to move some apps and content from the old phone to the new via WiFi, and I got to choose which ones to move.That's as far as I've gotten so far but as I said, I already  LOVE it.Read full review...",5

The phone is also surprisingly tough for what it is, we had a 200lb goat step squarely on the screen and didn't hurt it a bit. I have managed to drop it in the pond and the watering trough and it been no worse for wear. The screen is bright enough to see well even in full sun. And it has excellent reception, my old phone only gets one bar where we live, this one gets three. The o my issue I have had for it is finding a good screen protector that will work with the slight bevel of the glass and cover the whole screen, other than that it's a wonderful phone.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Functionally great used phone.,"I bought this phone because mine had a broken camera lens and would have cost too much to repair it.  This newly purchased used one works perfectly even though it has quite a bit of cosmetic damage.  But since I keep it in a full wallet style case, the cosmetics don't even show.

Great buy!Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Nice phone for the money.,"It's supposed to be new but I have my doubts. Seems more like refurbished, no Samsung labelled anything. Works as it should.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Looks and works like a brand new phone,"I was initially reluctant to by another refurbished phone, since the refurbished Galaxy S5 I bought several years ago gave me a number of problems.  But this S7 arrived looking brand new -- no scratches or marks of any kind -- and everything works perfectly.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,LOVE this phone,This is my first smart phone.  Sometimes I think it out smarts me though.  It is just right to put into your pocket and it has really helped on looking stuff up.  I have used a flip phone so long that I sometimes miss it for the smaller footprint it has.  The features that this phone has is really nice.  Seems to hold a charge all day.  Love the message app and the pictures are beautiful.Read full review...,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Abandoned my iPhone 6 for this s7 and am grateful.,"I had my iPhone for 3-4 years and had it jailbroken for full options. I knew it like the back of my hand. I bought this once it's antenna died because I wanted to try something new and right off the bat it had more perks than my jailbroken iPhone.I was worried I was going to get a used piece of junk, but two weeks in and it seems like it was actually brand new and running perfectly. I just learned that I can't turn on split view shortcuts or they'll kill the battery.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Samsung always reliable,"Needed to upgrade from my S4 and have always used Samsung. I got a good value in my Samsung S7, New, Unlocked. Feels great in my little lady hands. Everything feels so smooth, from the hardware to the software. Batteries never last as long as we wish they would but it's satisfactory for my needs. The only issue I had was how many restarts and updates I had to go through because I bought an older phone. It's good to go now. Love the fingerprint technology, once it got my print it works every time.Read full review...",4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great deal for an older model phone,"My unlocked Samsung phone arrived quicker than expected.  You almost could not tell this was a reburb phone except for the packaging.  The phone worked better than I expected and would purchase again if needed.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,The best smartphone I have owned.,"After debating on whether to get this phone or wait for the S8, I am glad that I brought this one.A Droid 4 user for quite a while , this S7 is lightning fast, has more space (32GB) and the gold color makes it stand out.  I own a Samsung TV and tablet so why not a Samsung Galaxy S7?  This phone has super battery life and the always on display is a plus.  Also, the Samsung charger charges the phone quickly.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Still a great phone after a few years,"Bought to replace my S7 with cracked front and back glass.

Transferred using Smart Switch and was up & running quickly.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Nice phone, but not an eye catcher.","I just recently upgraded from an S5 to the S7. The S7 has a beer operating system and a couple subtle differences, but it's essentially the same size (physically) as the S5 and doesn't feel much different in terms of operation, speed, etc. The only real change seems to be that it's running Nougat as opposed to Marshmallow. Get an S5 with Nougat and you have an S7.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,A solid Android phone,"Unless you are into mobile gaming, the S7 is a solid Android phone.  My first one lasted through four years of heavy use before it began developing hardware problems that could not be fixed with a factory reset.  It was easy and affordable to get a new S7.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Love the phone, not the packaging.","The phone is in good physical condition and functions as expected.  You may need to do a manual update as they aren't using the most recent AOS and won't update automatically if you're not putting them under Verizon contract.  I would have given it 5 stars but the packaging was less than stellar.  The box was fine (cocooned in packing tape) but inside was the AC adapter (Samsung branded), matching power cable (aftermarket), and the phone just had 1 sheet of large bubble wrap....not taped.  Like laid in on one side and just folded up and around loosely leaving one side open.  The phone could be heard thumping around inside the box (which may have contributed to some of the superficial scratches on the screen).Read full review...",4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great phone,"So I'm not the guy that has to have all the latest tech no matter how much it costs, but I do like having great stuff that will last. I usually keep my phones for a couple years. The S7 is a little heavier than my last phone, but it is glass and metal not plastic. It feels good in my hand, I did buy a case for it as it is a little more slick than my last phone. The battery easily lasts all day, but I don't use it a huge amount. The camera takes pictures much faster than my old one did and they are good quality.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,AT&T Galaxy S8,"This is a well designed piece of technology. The hardware is state of the art. Unfortunately, content doesn't sync automatically. I haven't yet figured out if it's AT&T related, Samsung related, or Android 7.0 itself. Also, the phone came with AT&T Apps installed that cannot be uninstalled, they keep running and consuming memory, battery, and data... and I do not use any services from AT&T.The display is awesome, the 64GB system memory, 256GB SD memory, and octa-core processor are also a welcome feature. The ""used"" phone looks brand new and I had no problems porting my old number to Cricket.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Was Just as decribed! All I needed to make it work was a SIM card! Love that I get to chose what to install or keep! Ty!,"Love the idea of not having apps I don't use or want. It seems a little thin with wise compared to the height, but i'm getting use to it quickly. I don't like that the changed some of the personalization features, They (Samsung) have made it more difficult to set your own ringtones and notification. Instead of having a button the have a slide out. They also added Bixby, A talking assistant, not sure about her yet. In my opinion the took some of the settings away. Again, having to do with personalizing. over all a great phone, just takes a bit to get use to some of the changes.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great Phone,"I have had a Samsung S5 for many years. It has been giving me problems and working slow. I had upgraded my wife's phone earlier to a Samsung S9. I didn't want to spend over $600 for a phone like I did with hers. I read reviews of the S8 and after looking at all the different refurbished phones and new decided to go new as the cost was not that much more than the refurbished. The phone seems to be working beautifully and no problems so far. Battery life for me is usually 24 hours before I need to recharge, but it still isn't that low (40-50%). I had liquid screen protector applied and bought a good case to protect the phone. I am not the type who puts my phone in my pocket and it falls out every time I bend over. I think that the phones for as much as they cost, I will make sure it is not broken. Some people don't seem to worry about those things until the lose or break their phone. Then they complain about the cost to fix. That's like driving your car on a four wheel drive road and complain when you wreck it.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Good phone with some rough edges,"Pro: Great camera, battery life and displayCon: Weaker connectivity, buttons at bottom are very 2005I got this phone for the camera and big battery. My previous phone was an HTC One M7. The camera on the HTC was not so hot, but the user interface was good. I didn't realize how good until compared with the S6. Often the S6 requires 4-6 clicks (selections) to do a task that took 3 clicks on the HTC. The camera is awesome on the S6 but getting images from the phone to the Mac has been a pain in comparison with the HTC. The gallery app sucks for emailing multiple images, a task that was easy with the HTC. I still can't get bluetooth to connect well to my MacBook Pro. This wasn't an issue with the HTC. That said, my son has a Windows 10 PC and he connects easily.Read full review...",3

What a difference in speed and screen size, I can't believe I've used the rugby for 2 years. The size of the S6 makes it a little uncomfortable to carry in my front pocket but I think I will get use to it. The battery seems to last for ever and light weight. Easily transferred all my pictures and contact information with NFC feature.Read full review...",4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Almost flawless phone, cheap chinese cable (not OEM, cant quick charge)","Looked to be in original packaging. Charging brick seemed to be genuine Samsung quick charger, however the charging cable is a thinner gage cable than the ones that came with my previous 3 galaxy s6 actives and when it tries to quick charge it charges only slightly faster while the charhing brick gets VERY hot. I tried with my other charging bricks and they get hot as well if I use the included cable. The screen did not have the same factory film on it as the other att s6 actives I had before, and there are two vertical blemishes on the screen that span from top to bottom about 1 inch apart, almost like a rubber roller had gone over the display. If I wipe it off really well it isnt visible, but when the screen gets any condensation or gets dirty from use those strange vertical lines appear again. Overall the phone works pretty well, and for 150 bucks for a mostly flawless phone, I cannot complain, though I will have to find a different charging cable.Read full review...",3

So far it's legit. Had it for about 2 days. We'll see...Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Galaxy S6 Active,"Amazing phone, with moderate useage the battery can last me two days. The active button is handy as hell for using apps with two-way radio. Overall, its not bulky, fits in your hand comfortably, and though Ive yet to drop it, just feels all around more secure. I actually prefer the physical buttons on the bottom of the screen. Overall 10/10 and in a couple years if they still make this series of phone, I will continue to purchase them. Kind of silly that you cant purchase the phone in Canada, but it is worth importing.Read full review...",5

I got this phone and it was amazing, best I've ever owned. Then I got it wet and now its useless. The phone is supposed to be rugged and water resistant to military standards, which I thought were 6' deep. I waded into a stream with it in my pocket, submerging it about 1' deep for maybe a minute. The phone filled up with water and wouldn't turn on. I took it back home and have had it in rice for a few days, but I'm not optimistic...Read full review...",2

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Not durable,"I purchased the Galaxy s6 active refurbished about 3 months ago. Recently I bumped, not dropped, a weight against it as I was deadlifting and the lcd started to bleed. Purple splatters stained the inside, and the next day the phone went completely black and no longer vibrates when called. I believe it is dead. Refurbish process made this phone far less durable.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Broken in 1 week,"This is clearly not an active and durable phone. I was using a note 3 before this without a case for years and it never had any issues. Within a week of receiving this, the screen was not only cracked, but smashed in! From a fall less than 3 feet onto an even surface.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G,"I have not had a mobile cellphone as this in the past. It took me sometime to familiarize myself with the changes different from my old phone. After sometime of hit and miss and Utube, I was able to become adept in using this phone. Now to the phone itself, great looking phone with large viewing screen. The phone is easy to hold in my hand, do to the slim width and weight distribution. The screen is vivid and can be change to your custom viewing pleasure.  The interal storage is above average and is accessed quickly. I have not used the camera or video features too much, however what photos and videos I took are sharp and vivid colors. I am very pleased with this phone and it's features to this point. Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Good Phone.  Good Price.,"Product is as advertised.  Gently used.  No scratches or cracks.  Reasonable price, for a used 2-3 month old flagship phone.  Battery life is very good, about the same as my S10+.  Although some have complained about camera focus issues, I have not experienced any real problems.   As for the negatives, the claimed x100 is a joke.  It's really good up to x20, maybe x30.  I knew that from several reviews.  But x20 is much better than my previous camera.  It has been great for shooting pictures and video of wildlife.  The addition of the Pro Video functionality is a big plus.  Screen quality, resolution, brightness, refresh rate, etc. is about as good as it gets.  I notice 120 Hz refresh is smoother, and I switch between 60 and 120 Hz.  Charging is very fast with the stock charger: 25 Watts.  Found out the 45W charger is no faster than 25.  The ability to add an extra MicroSD card was very important for me.  I installed a 512GB to hold all the video and pictures.  Included headphones are nice, but there is no dedicated 1/8"" jack.  That's a minor complaint.  The S20 Ultra does not have FM radio enabled like the old S10+, another minor complaint.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the item.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Lightweight and everything I wanted in a phone,"I have been using it for about a month now and I can say that I am very happy with my purchase. I love the reminder widget that lets me type out reminders and then cross them off my list. same with the notes widget tat lets me see selected notes on the home screen. It is very light weight compared to the iphone X and  I am very happy with the camera quality too! bluetooth and wifi connect very quickly and the blue light filter is really good for my eyes, since i always have it on at some level, my eyes don't feel tired after staring at the screen for a long time.I'm upgrading from a note 3 which i had for 7 years so I feel like i won the lottery with this phone. I bought the aura glow and i didn't want to get any scratches or anything on it so stuck it in a seacosmo phone case. it charges up super fast too!Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Phone seems to have issues. ,1.The touch screen is not sensitive enough! You have to press hard to get it to work.2.Making a phone call is almost impossible. The call drops everytime 3or4 tumes before it connects.3. The phone was difficult to set up to my Verizon carrier. They had to do major trouble shooting to get it on the network.The phone came as described new looking with all accessories. But I'd rather have a smooth working phone then accessories. Overall this experience wasn't a good one.Read full review...,3
Cell Phones & Smartphones,The Note 10+ scores a 10 PLUS!,"Not that much bigger than my Note10 but 10+ has some improved features over the 10 - better camera, bigger battery and ability to add SD card  A big Plus for both 10 and 10+ is the Dex app that allows you to plug in to your PC/Mac via USB cable and  have the functionality of  the screen size of your PC/Mac and use your computer's keyboard. Although this is a 2019 model, it still has plenty of bang to go up against the big bucks 2020 models. The only minor con I have found is the fingerprint reader. It's more sensitive since the sensors are in the glass. So. if your fingers are damp from frequent washing in this Corona mad age, it could be a challenge to unlock, leaving you waiting for your ""prints"" to come in.Read full review...",5

Didn't use CAMERA much due to current world virus crisis.Bottom line: I got this phone new about week ago...still learning and as I mentioned, so far so good.I gave it 4 stars, because my old phone Nexus 6P did work very well for me and I still using it for occassionally web browsing, watch YouTube and listen music.My personal opinion Samsung Note 10 plus is very good phone, it does what I need to do and fast.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great Deal,"Galaxy S8 active was the phone I had, it was so durable that it laid in a traffic lane for an hour. As I pulled up to find it , I heard it get ran over again. The phone phone had no screen at all, and was still working, making all notifications and ringing with no way to operate. Had to order a replacement. Refurbished phone has brand new operating system with the latest features. New Screen and corners. Only complaint is the battery life but the phone does twice what my Last phone did, maybe thats why shorter battery life. Still best $160 phone on the planet.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Almost brand new,"Purchased this as a brand new device, but the packaging it came in was not the factory packaging. The phone itself seems to be in new condition and looks great! There is a bit of dust in a crease on the screen but that's hardly noticeable. For all intents and purpose, this phone is brand new and came with all accessories (USB Wall Adapter, USB-C Cable, USB-A to C adapter, Micro USB to C adapter, and a pair of AKG headphones). The device itself runs well and doesn't look refurbished. The IMEI also checks out in software.Overall good purchase!Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Sturdy, heavy, mean looking","The phone seems well built, and it is heavy which will take some getting used to. Rear fingerprint scanner is reliable but hard to reach (get used to) coming from a phone with a front scanner. Processor is very fast compared to S6. Battery life started off at almost 2 days of normal use, but seems like it may be decreasing already.Note I purchased a refurbished phone with deep scratch on aluminium body for better price than new. I have no idea how and how long the phone was in use.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great phone!,"Extremely clean phone.  It looks like new even though seller rated 9.5 out of 10.  I couldn't find anything that justified anything but 10 out of 10.  Samsung accessories were included.  Battery life is incredible.  I go three full days without charging and there is still 30% left.   Fingerprint scanner is very easy to use and very rarely makes me try more than once to unlock the phone.   The camera on this phone has much better macro than my old Galaxy S5.   I considered buying a lesser known brand than Samsung, just to save a few dollars.  I'm very glad that I didn't.  I have nothing negative to report about this phone. Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Overall a good buy.,"Has more than just some dings and scratches as described. It looks like someone literally overheated the back cover too much while trying to fix it and left a huge scar from the suction piece on it. I expected some scratches and scrapes around the edges from the description but not such an obvious mark for being marked as ‚ÄúGOOD‚Äù.However, looking past that cosmetic fault since it‚Äôll be in a case mostly, the screen itself is in near perfect condition and the phone so far is running like it‚Äôs brand new. Which was my main concern when ordering refurb/used. So, in that aspect it‚Äôs a bit better than I expected.I‚Äôve only had it for the day so far, and as long as it continues running smoothly as it is, I can say it was worth the buy when you‚Äôre in need of a quick affordable replacement and want something a bit more durable than most other newer model phones tend to be.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Very pleased with this product....,"My Samsung Galaxy S8 Active is everything I was hoping for and then some. The screen of the phone was like brand new, 100% blimish free. The back and sides of phone had minor wear, just like the discription stated, which is to be expected when buying a used product. The phone is up to date and the battery life is amazing especially after having chase down a charger 3x a day with my old Samsung Note. With the S8 I can go to work for 12+ hours and still be above 70% battery life. It's nice being able to go to work or whatever and not have to worry about if my phone is off due to a dead battery. Very satisfied!Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Long battery life, good camera, easy to use.","Good phone. I like the long battery life and it seems to be pretty rugged., I'm a landscape contractor and  so far it's stood up to dirt, water and the everyday jars and bumps that come with my job.",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"The S8 Active is an excellent, tough phone perfect for phone-abusers","This phone, the Samsung s8 Active, is exactly what I wanted. It has a flat screen, metal around the edges, and a tough plastic back, unlike the all-glass curved-screen s8, s8+, and Note. Those I would break in a heartbeat. This one, while presumably not unbreakable, will hold up to a lot more abuse. It looks good, too. Crisp screen and good color. It is similar in appearance to my old s5, but with a lot more screen top to bottom and a bit more side to side. The native keyboard is quite usable. As for the camera, it's top notch. I took a picture of somebody in the middle distance, cropped it, blew it up, and no pixelation.The battery lasts a long time, since it is 4000 mAh as opposed to the s8's 3000. That's a lot of battery for a normal-sized phone.It's a little heavy because it is slightly thicker to hold the non-replaceable battery. Nothing you can't get used to. Fits neatly in a pocket, but you might want to get a screen protector because the outer layer of the screen is plastic and will scratchRead full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Absolute perfection. This is a brand spankin‚Äô new S8 Active,This is a Samsung S8 Active. Samsung discontinued the Hardened ‚ÄúActive‚Äù line of phones after the S8 - which is really too bad.These phones are made for active people that may or may not work in offices.  Gorilla glass screen and rubber edges to protect it when dropped. It‚Äôs the very first phone I have had where it would consistently read my fingerprint to unlock..Read full review...,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Mint condition,"The phone itself is brand new and unlocked. I already used it in Mexico on AT&T network and I am currently using it in Europe with Vodafone network. Works like a charm.The packaging and accessories are new aswell, but are general travel accessories issued by Samsung. However, good quality! Longest battery life I have seen so far. Easily 3 days if needed, 2 days if normal use during commute and evening browsing. It lasted a full 12 hours day of excessive usage as a tourist: hundreds of photos taken, screen-on time 8 hours, GPS navigation, some time on youtube. It still had 18% left when I got back in the hotel.Outstanding built quality. Used it on the beach in sand, had salty water splashes, and washed it in the sink under water jet with no problems what-so-ever. The only phone I owned that comes just close to this in built quality, is my former Nokia N8 (now, if you don't know how good that phone was, just imagine it was one of the best Nokia phones ever).I am very happy with the product and I heartily recommend it!

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Too many features to even describe,This phone came just as described. Excellent condition with minimal wear. The phone itself is fantastic. It takes great pictures with tons of different features within the camera. The battery will last almost 2 days and the phone itself is very durable. Would highly recommend.Read full review...,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great phone for the money,"The scratches suggests that it was in hard use, probably not a store demo as described. It was definitely dropped multiple times as the edges have scratches all around the phone with some burrs as well (the screen doesn't have any scratches, only the hard edges of the phone).Other than that the phone is as described, and in my opinion it looks generally much better in real life than on photos (I was hesitant about this model as I didn't like the design in reviews, but I didn't regret buying it).There are some icons burned in at the top left corner and some very light burn-ins at the bottom half of the screen, but they are only visible on light background (as described), they are not at all visible on dark background so I don't bother them. There is a night mode in Android 9 and it hides these issues in most cases.The camera is great and the phone feels very responsive, I like it, definitely worth the price.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Battery Life is Amazing..,"I am still trying to learn all the new stuff on here but I love it. Battery life is amazing, Camera is Amazing, so far there is nothing  that I don't like..",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Great used, higher end phone","The Galaxy s8 Active so far is a great phone. It takes the dust, dirt and sweat in my pocket all day long. I use no port plugs and it charges every time. I did have to replace the power cord it came with though. For a used phone, at a quarter of the price, I'm happy.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Durable and long battery life,The Samsung Galaxy S8 active is a really great phone because it has an amazing performance with the extended battery life and can last me the whole day without me reaching for the charger. The build quality is enhanced with its built-in case and can withstand many drops and scratches. It is a great phone and will probably keep on using it for the many years to come.Read full review...,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Good phone. Gamble on how much shadow you get,First Phone works well has a slight shadow only visible on light background.Second phone also fully functional but heavier shadowing.Phone is a nice size and I like the texture of the back. Gives me a little grip while at work if my hands are wet or in gloves.Also most gloves seem to be able to work with this screen.Read full review...,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Samsung S8,"I love this phone! Slim, sleek, and the screen display is as big as the entire phone which I love the most. Definitely a good buy!",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Excellent phone BUT,"So far I love this phone, using it all day and I still over 80% battery at the end of the day. It is FAST, very FAST. Every thing seem to work better than I had hoped for. The only problem is I feel it is spying one me. After a week, it came up with a message say that it detected that I go to bed at 8:00 and wanted to know if I wanted my ring and message tones disabled at that time. How did it know that I was in bed? At other times I notice that while I am talking to a client of friend the screen lights up and my words are on the screen. I have disabled Bixby and am working on disabling voice recondition. I have found a way of disabling updates, as once I get a phone working perfect, T-mobile sends down an update that screws everything up.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,It's tough as hell,"It's heavy, lol. I got tired of my fragile S8 and decided to get one of these. It basically has a built in case, and super strong glass, but supposedly it's susceptible to lighter scratches. I just ordered a screen protector... It was definitely heavier than I imagined, but it's worth it. Great product, great deal!Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Moving up from the 7 to the 8,"I have used the Active series from many years, I am very familiar with the line. The S8 is all of the S7 and better with one major flaw, there are no buttons. Those of us who use gloves to work or play must remove them to answer calls or to dismiss them. There were several functions around the physical buttons that were needed and are now gone. I understand the idea that it should have been better sans buttons, but in a real world application it is an annoyance at the least. Yes, I have gloves that allow me to use a touch screen, but none thick enough to wear on the slopes. One other thing but this phone is used and may have had its glass changed without me being told, while removing my screen guard with a thin razor blade the screen received a small crack, a star. I was shocked, I had dropped an S7 from the second floor with no damage once.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Okay yes, very good, to thank, a many thank you. Okay.","Not too shabby. I had an S6 active and wanted to upgrade, so this was a good one. I'm glad I did, it's better. Had to switch to the USB-C but that's a''ight. Has an issue occasionally saying water detected in the charging port, but I bought another USB-C and haven't had the issue for a minute. I just restarted the phone when that would happen, when trying to connect to PC, and it solved the problem. Overall, I'm glad I made the purchase, used phones are still good value.Thank you.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Love my new Galaxy S8 Active!,"Rugged, sleek and intuitive. Miss the physical Home button that has been the staple of the Galaxy series but easy enough to get used to.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Holy shitballs this is great!,"With previous Active model Galaxies, you would trade some of the features for the durability. In the case of the s8 and s8 active, the features are almost identical and the camera is just as amazing on both models. It doesn't seem as rugged as the s6 or s7 active but I can assure you it is. It can withstand a drop in concrete or a fall in the water. Very impressed with this phone.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Samsung Delivered!,"Samsung‚Äôs S8 and S8+ rank highly on their own, especially when compared to other flagship smartphones released in 2017. The design is beautiful and reflect the effort Samsung has placed into designing the most futuristic, feature packed smartphones over the past 4 to 5 years. When you think back to the gimmicky Note Edge, you can easily forgive Samsung for taking the risk to bring to curved edges to their phones. The Edge has steadily been refined, and culminates with the S8 series. What's more impressive is that Samsung has dropped the ""Edge"" moniker and normalized curved edges as part of their premium smartphone line up. I was among the millions of buyers who were forced to return their Note 7's, and can now say Samsung has gone beyond and above to produce a phone that has made me all but forget the loss of Note 7's beauty. The form factor is spectacular, and shows  that we can use large screen phones, without extremely large bodies. The 6.2"" phone is approximately the same size as the iPhone 7+ or Google Pixel XL, and goes to show how much space is wasted on smartphones with large bezels. All in all I love my S8+, the batter life is phenomenal and lasts a full day even used in""Performance Mode"". The S8+ actually has more features than users need, but provides different users with various ways to interact with their phones. I don't appreciate the location of the finger print sensor, my finger always has to slide over the camera lens before reaching the thing, but it's really not a big deal considering that one wipe from a soft cloth renders the lens clear and ready for to take awesome pics. The 18:9 screen ratio takes a very short while to adjust to, and once you do you'll appreciate how the slightly thinner but longer form has helped to bring about the S8 evolution. If you're an Android enthusiast, the S8 used a good a launcher such like Nova  will help you to create home screens as beautiful as these phones are on the outside. Last but not least, don't forget to pickup a nice clear case to protect your phone without sacrificing its stellar appearance.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great phone!,"Ordered this to replace my Nexus 6P and happy I did. Screen is beautiful, snappy response, and the move back to external memory expansion is great.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,I love this phone,I was a little worried ordering a phone I could see or touch. When I got the phone it had a screen protector that had a chip in the glass but after removing seen there was nothing wrong with my phone. Other than some small minor scratches on the back. Not really a big deal. The phone was a T-Mobile phone and was unlocked as advertised. After inserting my At&t SIM card and updating the software the phone ask me to restart and upon doing so all evidence of T-Mobile was erased and all At&t apps and start up screen was installed. Have not had a single problem with the phone or set up. So happy with my purchase.Read full review...,5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Love the Big Screen, Stylus Option, Speed & Versatility!","Previously used a Samsung Note 3, then S3 then S7 (while husband used S4-S6). Then tried the LG V30+ since I wanted the larger screen. Ended up gifting it and bought a used S8+ and Note 8.  Do not like the curved edge of the S8+; absolutely love the Note 8!!  The S-pen adds so many options; it's faster and packed with lots of awesome features!In addition to the fingerprint, facial recognition and iris scan, it also has ""Device Maintenance"" so you don't need a separate ""Task Kilker"" or ""Optimizer.""One of the advertised benefits of the Note 9 is the ability to take pics/selfies w the S-pen. Found out recently that you can set the Note 8 to take a selfie by having your palm out in front of the camera. Once the camera registers your palm signal (by showing a square on the screen), you have 2-3 secs to pose before the pic is taken. Others likely already know that, but I didn't since I don't usu read user manuals. :)  Just an example of a cool feature.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Bad head phone jack.,The device is beautiful but the headphone jack does not work.  A bit disappointed for what I paid.  It's  that or no matter what type of aux cord I buy even the ones that are for the Note 8 not one of them has worked.Read full review...,3
Cell Phones & Smartphones,The phone came like NEW!,"When I received it, it looked like a new phone, very nice good looking and clean! I was happy using it for a couple weeks but then the charging port was burnt one day because I think the cheap cable was the cause of it. Well, at first I was worried and didn't know what to do. I thought I lost my new phone. But later I thought about a wireless charger so searched it in Amazon amd ordered it. I was nervous while waiting, what if the battery of the phone is already ruined then this wireless charger would also be a waste. To my surprise, when I received this wireless charger and tried immediately my almost dead phone revived! Wow~ so emotional I screamed Yay! My phone is back! Since then I love my phone more and I totally blame to the cable that had ruined my impecable phone. So, do not ever try to connect any kind of cable to charge if you really care your new phone.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Awesome phone with some up & downs,"It's an awesome phone.Performance is insane. Dimensions are comfortable to hold and use. Keyboard input is better than LG or previous gens for big hands. Screen graphics are nice, not a fun of the round corners but I can see the appeal. Speaker has a better sound than LG and previous gens as well. The Cam is just awesome. Front face has up to 8mp for some fun quality selfies. Auto focus and lighting has improved tremendously from single cam phones. It weights a bit but looks good and android 9 goes all out with modes and tweaks. Not a phone to have a glass protector, it loses touch sen. Stick with film. Also Batt life is shorter than normal. Led notification light not as strong as some older note.Overall, Clearly better than any previous  gen. Specially on photos and performance, RAM and internal space.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Glad I switched to this phone!,"I had the LG V20 before I purchased the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. I am glad that I switched to this phone.It is lighter in weight - the LG V20 was quite heavy, especially with the added case. The Note 8 is light, even with a case. I like that the power off button is on the side of the phone versus on the back like the LG V20.The Note 8 seems to have great battery life. I can play games for an hour and only use 10 or 20% of my battery.The extended screen on the Note 8 is cool, but sometimes its a pain if you are trying to click on something on the internet that falls right on this area of the screen.That's about it for now. I have only had the phone for about two weeks . Thus far I am pleased.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Samsung Galaxy Note 8,"I bought a reconditioned phone. It looked and functions like a brand new phone. It was delivered much earlier than expected.It is a great looking and feeling phone. It has so many options that it is confusing. What is clear is that Samsung's Bixby is not yet ready for prime time. And why should it be compared to Google Voice which has spent years perfecting itself? Microsoft offered me a 'take over' administration of the Note 8 software and screen and I accepted. I also switched to Verizon messages because it allows me a more complex and somewhat better format. I switched from an LG4 H818, which was an unlocked, European version of the LG4. Was a great phone but was brought out before the ability to make and received calls over WiFi was an integral part of the phone. I used AT&T as my carrier. Thus, when I was in the desert, Rancho Mirage, Indio, etc. 4G or Lite reception was terrible. My Version Note 8 works like a charm over WiFi where my LG4 wouldnt function. The Note 8 is terrible in sunlight. Can not read the screen and I need to shade it if I am outside and receive a call. The options are unending, so some of it is just picking the right options and adding the apps that I needed. I had a 128Gb SD card that easily transferred to the Note 8, which I bought with 64 Gb, I use my phone for alot of things, and transferred my 128 GB card without a problem. The Note 8 read the SD card and installed all the apps, music and photos that were on the card to itself.The only drawback Samsung's lack of giving up on Bixby and using Google voice. It would make life so much easier from the start instead of having to switch over to Google and to find that Google voice will not perform many functions when using the phone, which Bixby can do but constantly misinterprets my voice. For an extremely expensive, flagship Samsung phone, after their battery burn up problems, to not give top performance is an extremely bad feature for this phone to lack.B.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Samsung Note 8,"I always loved the Samsung Note family. They just got better over the years. I went with the 8 because of the cost against the 10 and 20. I love the 6.3 inch screen, long battery life, memory expansion to 250GB and of course the s-pen. Great features and the crystal clear screen. Works well with my other devices, too. Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,An amazing phone,"I went from a Galaxy Note 4 to this one so I kinda knew what to expect, but this phone has surpassed my expectations in every way.  The screen is super responsive to my touch, the phone responds quickly and there is plenty of room to store stuff.  Battery life is a LOT better than on the Note 4, which had to spend every night on the charger.  Lots of great new features and of course the widest selection of apps (suck it iPhone).  Camera takes great photos and videos...what else?  Just a great phone.  Narrower and taller than my Note 4 and weirdly difficult to pick up from a flat surface because the edges are smooth and curved, but that's my only complaint.  Also works with cordless chargers, so THAT's really cool.  Great phoneRead full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Love the Note 8,Delivered very fast.  Phone looks brand new.  Not a mark on it.  Came clean and ready to install all that I need.  Very fast internet.  We'll see how long the battery lasts after some months.  Love the phone so far.Read full review...,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Best Note EVER,"I've owned a Note series phone since Samsung first came out with them. Yes, I got caught up in the Note7 disaster, not once, but twice, and after that, suffered through the  anticipation for the Note8 with a S7 Edge, which is like driving a Mini after having driven a Ferrari for a long time. It was absolut torture. The lack of the actual ""Home"" button took only an hour to get used to, but the Note8 is awesome, in all its splendor and glory. I am so glad to have my S-pen back...You never know how much you need it, until it's gone.  I'd 100% recommend the Note8 to anybody. It's a powerhouse of a phone, bar none.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Best Money Can Currently Buy,"Had the note 3 and note 4 and loved them both. Chose to go the smaller phone route and it worked but I still missed the beautiful display of the larger phablets. This phone has it all!

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Samsung Note family of phones continue to improve.,"Continue to love the Samsung Note family. Well designed and many operating improvements to my old Note 4. Negative is the curved screen which makes it almost impossible to utilize a screen protector, I actually put Superglue on all four corners. (I'm on my fourth - read other online comments). Verizon told me they may go back to flat screen in future models, however still love using the phone and its intuitive operating system.Read full review...",4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Appears to be new...,"Phone appears to be new, but cable provided does not allow for fast charging. In fact it gives me an error message when I plug in that specific cable. It says ""Incomplete Connection: Make sure the charger is properly connected"". I know it's the cable because I tested another one I already had and it works fine. Would have given 5 stars but I'm not 100% confident everything in the box is original or that this isn't actually a refurbished phone.Read full review...",4

Its fast, durable like no other, does all then a ton more AND its a NOTE with all PLUS we can expect!Tho we should NEVER see anything compete, Samsung has strayed a bit that THIS MUST BE UNMATCHED or not just have the S series that are equal/better than anything iphone puts out!  This note is durable, is incredible with the camera options and FAST...but 8gb ram exists in phones so why does the baddest phablet NOT beat?!  Well, this is a SOLID set up to be sure that we are still loyal!  I KNOW that Samsung will prove that phones WONT contend, this will return to the peak of ultimate phablets!  S series will set phone standards and all will be correct again!Prepare for all you can expect, tho some WOW may not be the usual we look forward to...but, there are little to details considered less than standard setting, and our pen brings us back to a balanced universe!I will skip the 9 and hope to see something extraordinary for the X!  Considering 6 didnt exist and 7 DIDNT happen beyond disappointed consumers...SAMSUNG WILL BE UNVEILING SOMETHING UNMATCHED AND THIS 8 is an example of WHY we appreciate the EXTRA in a device that allows us to take command if all in our daily!Read full review...",5

I use it to read the news every morning, since the screen real estate is almost 40% larger than my iPhone 6s. it's got an amazing AMOLED screen, but it's too big to carry around on a daily basis. I'm also tied into the Apple ecosystem, so I like getting all of my text messages and emails on all three of my Apple devices.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Smartphone with all the needed features,Galaxy Note 5 was what I was looking for in an affordable smartphone. If anything I wish Samsung still offered a replaceable battery as was the case in my Note 3. But it is what it is.,5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Excellent, except for the battery life","The phone is excellent, except that that I have to buy a power bank as a back up in the event the battery is about to die. Samsung has to do better than that for their batteries.",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Overall good.,Battery cane fast. Negative is the battery is not an apple certified battery.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Samsung Continues To Excel,"The best Samsung Galaxy S series phone I've had so far. I like the size of the phone, but may have preferred the S20 Plus. I have large hands and would have enjoyed a slightly larger screen.",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Camera is part of the screen now,"Its a bit smaller than my old S8+ which makes it hard for a bigger guy like me to type. Also, they put the front camera as part of the screen so now it distracts me qhen I am surfing the qeb because this camera is literally part of the screen, looking at me. Other than that its ok. Wouldnt recommend it though. Weird design.Read full review...",3
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Learning an upgraded phone,"""Swiftkey"" doesn't work nearly as well on this phone. Frequently I have to resort to single letter entry. Most other issues I'm having with it are just a matter of becoming accustomed to differences between this and my J7. Some are due to the fact that I bought a phone advertised as unlocked, but it was locked to AT&T. The process of unlocking it has been annoying, not the fault of this phone, however. Picture colours are not accurate.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Excellent Phone for iPhone Converts,"As an avid iPhone user the past 9 years, this phone has been my first jump into the world of Android and it has not disappointed. The form factor being slightly taller and more narrow than my most recent iPhone Xr makes one-handed operation much easier. T-Mobile has also rolled out 5G to my neighborhood so the connectivity is much better than LTE in my home. The screen is very nice to look at and I am appreciating how customizable everything is on Samsung's OneUI 2.0. If you're looking for a ""compact"" phone by today's standards with good connectivity, excellent build quality, and pleasant user interface, I highly recommend this phone.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,So far so good.,So far this is a pretty fast phone.The only 3 issues that I have with it.They are settings/options that were on my S5 that the S20 doesn't have.I'm very very disappointed with that and that Samsung left those options out.Read full review...,4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Over-rated and laden with bloatware!,"I am finding the transition to this phone needlessly complicated.  I am annoyed that the mfg. has chosen the apps and has done so/integrated them in a way that makes it difficult to delete that which, for me, is excessive, needless, useless garbage.  I would neither recommend Samxung nor will I buy another of their products.  I 'will' be replacing this S205G.Read full review...",2

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great Phone (used),"Purchased used (w/burn-in issue). Other than disclosed issue, is a great  phone.  Also a great bargain at a mere fraction of the new cost.  Battery doesn't last as long as J7, but phone has much better features. The fingerprint biometric is by far the best feature; having to use a pin for G-Pay was a drag (especially for NYC subway OMNY system).Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,good phone i give it 3.5 stars,"pros perfect size, fast, nice camera,battery life ok. cons screen raised shape sticks up above the case. con the back cover is glass and glued down would be hard to change the battery.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Samsung Galaxy 9. SM-G960 is a very good smartphone.,"The Samsung Galaxy S9 is my first Samsung phone. So I had to get used to it (which is true for any new cellphone)  When I first got it, I thought it was rather small, smaller than than the Android smartphones I have had previously. Even with the hard plastic protective case, it is small. But I quickly adapted to using it, it is relatively easy to use, And I found it small size is actually a good thing because it fits nicely into shirt pockets. Overall I am very pleased with overall performance and ease of operation of this phoneRead full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Nice but a little frustrating,Nice phone but some features changed from previous Galaxy S7....Message app is new and confusing at start; c type charging cord made it necessary to buy a brand new cord to use away from home or in car unless you want to carry the original cord where ever you go.  Unable to switch between carriers when current carrier (T-Mobile) service is not available.Read full review...,4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Just like new.,"This is a replacement for a stolen phone. I bought one in ""like new"" condition and it was - in the original box with all accessories, just perfect and apparently never used.  It worked perfectly out of the box as soon as the SIM card was inserted. Battery life exactly as expected - must charge every night, but lasts all day - and I use it a lot & in low-signal areas where it needs to hunt for a tower quite often.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Brand new S9, fast ship and great phone","I‚Äôll break this up into two parts: the Galaxy S9 and my experience with the seller.  First, the phone was brand new, it was not old, refurbished, just new, in the box with all the wrappings and protections of a new phone.  The seller shipped it quickly and packaged it well, and the price was super!  Next, the S9 is a great phone, but not excellent.  The size is perfect, just slightly longer than my iPhone X, it fits comfortably in my large hands and I‚Äôm able to one-hand it easily.  I don‚Äôt like the rounded edge for multiple reasons; people can see what you‚Äôre looking more easily from the side, most cases don‚Äôt protect the edge leaving it vulnerable to breakage, and it is sensitive to the touch, causing you to accidentally touch things that you didn‚Äôt intend (like turning a page on Kindle).  The battery is only so-so, I haven‚Äôt played around enough with settings, but on power saver it will last one day with gameplay, I hoped for a little better (for example, my 1yo iPhone X lasts longer).  The camera is excellent, it takes great low-light pictures and super videos, it still has the video pause capability which I enjoy over the iPhone.  All else is really good, a few quirks like the calendar not being able to parse recurring appointments easily (bi-weekly, every 3rd Thursday, etc), and Bixby (I haven‚Äôt used it, but the fact you can‚Äôt program the raised button for an alternate action without activating Bixby is annoying).   If you get the S9, enjoy, it‚Äôs a great phone!Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Awesome Phone,"I have had an iPhone for years and years and decided to switch after I was viewing the Galaxy in Walmart.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great Phone,"This is my first time trying a Samsung phone. All my smartphones have been HTC. The Galaxy's seemed to have a good following. I like to save money so tried ordering the S8. I had issues with two of them and had to return them. Decided to pay more and go with the S9. At least I was still saving alot compared to purchasing the S10 or S20 right now. This phone feels great, I was able to get a good slim case and screen protector for it. I'm extremely happy with this phone and a fairly easy switch from HTC.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,the S9 is still much better than most mid range new phones for 2019,I researched cell phones before looking for a good deal in my price range. Every review stated that the S9 was an upgrade to the previous models and still much better than most mid range new phones for 2019. My S9 is a signficant upgrade from my old cell phone. I am still watching instructional youtube videos to set the phone up the way I want it. The front camera is has many more options than I have thought about using and the apps that can be used are wonderful.Read full review...,5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Solid device for under $250,"it's got a snappy interface, punchy photography (a lot of software involved in tweaking the image for best appearance - and not necessarily realism), it is actually upgradeable to Android 10, nice sleek design (usage of case advised - since the back of the phone is made out of super smooth ""slippery"" ""fingerprint attractive"" glass, good quality audio (on the speakers and internally alike), Fingerprint reader is very responsive, more realistic than life display - a very good deal overall.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Better Than Most,"I bought a new phone and returned it, switching out for this open box model. This one is a better phone and does what I expect. However, it still has glitches that bother me. For example, it blanks out pages on Facebook that will only show by restarting the phone. In addition, the loading time, even when I'm at home with direct WiFi access, it seems to take long to load pages with high graphics. Finally, the battery runs out about twice as fast as my original Galaxy S9. This is the 4th phone I've bought to replace my original phone that I broke.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Really nice Galaxy S7,"Clearly a really nice phone. As advertised, it was essentially new and flawless. It was a great price for such a nice phone. If it lasts at least a year it will have been a good value. If it lasts two years, it will have been a great value.I was really happy to find a new ""U"" version, meaning factory unlocked.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,As good as new S7,"This is an awesome phone especially for the price. It isn't an S10 but it wasn't priced like one. I am very happy with this S7 as it has all the bells and whistles I require and it works flawlessly. A previous S7 I purchased had a problem with the dialer and I would have to position it just right and it would SOMETIMES make a call, It was very frustrating. This one works first time every time. Exceptional value for the money. At the price I paid, I was considering another for a spare.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Question why you want this phone,I hate this phone it I sent note intuitive and calls incoming and outgoing are difficult to manage.I can't think of. Thing positive about this phone .  Even the buttons Re badly placed.  It seems Samsung wants to force people to use Bixby by where the button Ismail placed.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,S10e ... A Very Cool Phone,"I love this phone. I tweaked the settings and get battery  life that lasts all day. Xcllnt  display; clear and bright. Camera has a ton of flexibility and pictures are sharp. There's a normal (1/8"" stereo) headfone jack and micro SD slot that accepts cards up to 512GB. NOTE: You will need a USB C style cable to charge or connect this fone to  computer as the older USB micro type cables won't fit. This S10e stomps my old Moto G5+ into the dirt.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Buy this phone now and tell your friends too,"Had for just a few days and so far in LOVE.  Don't want a huge phablet and don't need a lot of major features.  This is a MAJOR upgrade of my SamsungJ3v -- display is beautiful and fills the screen, response is fast, battery life better but not greatly (although it charges SUPER fast), and better cameras -- all while being about the same size.Love the headphone jack and that it comes w/buds on a nice long cord.  Just not ready for $$ for wireless buds right now.With the 128GB I can put all my music on it and any apps I want.  Was constantly managing space w/only 16GB on old phone.Great price for all it does as well.CONS--""Cartoony"" looking icons, but I can live with that.Read full review...",5

It does not come with it's own sim card, so you have to call MetroPCS to set it up with your old sim card or buy a new one from Metro which is only $10.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Replaced my old Galaxy S3,"I messed up the charger port on my old phone and wanted exactly the same phone again. It's great, but the version is different than old S3 so some things aren't exactly the same. Still, I don't see any need to pay a lot more for newer phones and features. This suits me just fine. And it was new!Read full review...",4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Great phone, big screen. Certainly a nice luxury, if you can afford it.","This is a snappy phone, even with the update to 4.3 (latest as of this writing). The screen is absolutely huge and bright, the camera as quick as a flash (heh). Lots of great Samsung/Android features, such as NFC, flash, widgets, GPS and so much more!This serves as a replacement to an old feature phone and Samsung Exhibit 2 I had to stay connected at work.Battery life is not great, in my opinion, as with Just wifi or just cell service the battery just gets me through the work day and into some of the evening before giving me warnings about 9% or 3% battery life.I'm a little apprehensive about breaking the glass screen, but I've had it for about a month and so far, so good, though I have dropped it twice (NOT onto cement, tile or rock).Read full review...",4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,So easy to use even a caveman can do it.,"The phone is awesome, learning new features everyday. And  thanks to T mobile's no contract I was able to get unlimited talk, text and data and reduce my  bill by 45.00 a month. So Now I can really enjoy this phone. I got a 50%  discount from Samsung and I purchased the Bluetooth for 24.99 plus shipping and handling. I paired the bluetooth by just tapping it to the phone, no more scanning for devices, which could get a little frustrating.Read full review...",5

Sitiing on the couch playing games and surfing the web is awesome.  My only real complaint is that the phone is huge, it barely fit in some of my jean pockets and forget about using it in the car. Two hands are needed for this phone.  Other than the size, it's a nice phone.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Amazing product1,I bought this because I needed a new phone and I saw this phone for a relatively good price considering that it is the newest samsung out right now. I really like the size of the phone and the screen. The different apps on the phone and the amount of things you can do on the phone is great.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Good phone but restricted to Samsung charging cables.,"It is a great phone, however, there is one problem which will cause me to get another model.  The micro usb port specs are not industry standard.  I found that I can only use Samsung cables to charge the phone.  If I use over the counter cables such as ones purchased from a convenience store, it won't charge.  These same convenience store cables will charge my other phones.Read full review...",4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Satisfied with the phone and its price.,"Teen child needed a new phone. Not going to buy the latest and greatest for $500 plus - I work for a living. The S3 was a good choice because the price was right, it has the smartphone features she wanted and it's been in  general public use for more than a few years. Only drawback is the feature sets when active and in use really tax the battery.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Excelent,"Overall it's a great phone. It has some excellent features that are very forward thinking. The battery life is average compared to most smart phones. Sound quality is only ok. I've read that one of the dual microphones have given a few customers some issues. I haven't had a problem so far, so fingers crossed. It's expensive if you buy it brand new but worth it if you can find a good deal on a used one. Would rate it 5/5.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,A great product with so much to offer!,"I was desperate for a new cellphone when I bought my Samsung. I think iPhones are overrated and I wanted a good quality product. I love my Galaxy, though it is large, it is a great resolution quality, so it works out. The sound is great and google chrome moves quickly and you can have so many tabs open at once! I turn the light down on my screen so the phone gets a full day of battery life. So far, it is a good experience. And I loooooove the notification indicator lights!Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,The phone that won't let you down!,"This product is amazing! The specs are great, especially the larger screen. I switched from the iPhone 5 to this phone, primarily for the sheer size. The size, speed and the 'customizability', though the service (other than 4-G/Wi-Fi areas) sometime is not very great (probably because I have t-mobile). Again, excellent product and would recommend this to any one.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Solid Performance Android Phone.,"I bought this phone used for my girlfriend.  I have a Galaxy Note II which is similar to this phone.  I was easily able to root the phone and install a CynaogenMod based KitKat ROM for her.  A few years ago this was a top of the line phone, and probably one of the most active phones that community-based ROMs are designed for.  A reliable phone for just about every need you could imagine.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,a Smart Phone Newbie's Opinion,"Screamin' Phone!  I'm new at Smart Phones, so I don't have much to compare to, but this one has allot of features and runs really fast on 4G or Wi-Fi.  I had some trouble with settings and had slow performance at first till I untangled the WiFi settings - I have an unlimited plan so I turn Wi-Fi off when I'm not using it.  Learned in just a few days to also TURN OFF Wi-fi and/or GPS when not using them as it runs battery down pretty fast, like to 15% by 3 pm from 6 am.  I bought used for a good price, luckily I got one with minimal wear.  Love that the battery is replaceable and it has a Micro SD card slot (now I've just got to figure out what to put on there, ha ha)Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Worth it,"Didn't want to spend a lot but wanted a decent phone. I didn't mind a used phone and the reviews were very positive. The battery life isn't great and sometimes it tends to get very hot, but I probably just need a new battery.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,My experience with this phone is excelltent. It works well .,I like the Galaxy s3 very much it is quite quick and does not exhibit any troubles or strange behaviors.It works just exactly as advertised but the one area that it is not excellent is the battery. Since it is a used phone maybe the battery was not new I finally bought an extended battery and that seems to cure it. I don't know if a new battery would have fixed it but the extended one did.I sold my iPhone 5C to buy this after reading the specs. It is as good as was described.Love the phone.Read full review...,5

If you have small hands, it is a handful.Don't understand complaint's  about photos, they look very good to me.The processor although good and of quality, is a little slower. We're talking having to wait only a moment or two so it's plenty good.It does not support  the external pad charging but it damn sure charges fast with the included charger. I like the USB-C plug in, don't have to fumble around to get the cable flipped  correctly to plug it in.

Not quite sure yet about battery life, because my S7 Prime held the charge much longer with regular use. A couple of screen scratches, expected.UPDATE: Great phone, very light signs of wear, battery life is good.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Looks good but has faulty features.,The phone will not connect through USB with my car.  Connection fails 100% of the time.  I've had it to the car dealer and they have checked it.  The problem isn't with the car as it connects with the phone of the service technician with no problem.  But it won't connect with my phone.  I took the phone and cord to Best Buy and was going to purchase a new cord.  But the sales person tested the phone with several cords they had on hand (and knew worked) and it would not connect properly with those either.  This led him to believe the problem is in the phone itself.  He suggested that the prongs inside the phone that are supposed to connect with the cord are not long enough to make a firm connection with the cord.Read full review...,1
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Affordable way to acquire top shelf phone!,"Absolutely LOVE this phone! First of all, it is physically beautiful. I got a clear cover so that the gorgeous lilac color isn't hidden. It is slim and thin and elegant and fits in my smallish hand so well. You absolutely need a cover, though, as the little sucker is really slippery without one. It's super fast, the screen is gorgeous and best of all, the speakers are hands down the loudest and best I've ever heard on a phone. Makes a HUGE difference being able to hear navigation in the car. The earphones also much better than I have heard anywhere else, also. Facial recognition to open it works really well, even in low light. Haven't done much with the camera yet, so can't comment on that. The battery life is more than fine for my normal use, and it recharges quickly on the wireless charger. Because I REFUSE to pay almost a thousand dollars for a phone, I purposely got the S9 instead of the S10 due to its much greater affordability. Kind of like we never buy brand new car - only one year old certified cars.There is an S9+ that is larger than this phone and it's a little more expensive, but I don't like giant phones. This one is the same width as an iPhone and maybe an eighth inch taller. It's PERFECT!Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Its Okay,Battery does not last long and voice texting is extremely slow to fill in what I am saying. But is is a nice phone other then that great picture and camera,4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Works better than the phone it replaced!,"We bought this phone as a replacement for my wife's Galaxy S6, which was having some problems.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Absence of physical HOME button, made this S9, a Hellphone","I upgraded my Galaxy S5 with S9 and sad to see its features, except for an excellent camera (for which I changed my S5).Galaxy S9 has no physical home button made it a hellphone. One need to scroll up and tap three times to get Home button function work.

Will be buying another soon for a gift.Read full review...,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Nice new phone.,"I am ""graduating"" from a Galaxy J7. My main reason for changing was to get the 64 Gb internal memory (16 just doesn't go as far as I thought it would.) So far I am liking this new phone, but it is taking some getting used to. I don't like the absence of a physical ""home"" button, and am still wishing it was as wide as my old phone. Also, it seems to require a much harder tap to make something happen - guess that might be something I could adjust myself??? All in all, glad I have it.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Samsung Galaxy 9s,I fried my Galaxy 6 which lead me to the Galaxy 9.  Very pleased with comparable size as I did not want a bigger phone.  The features may take some getting used to but overall extremely pleased!,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Powerful and handsome,"Pros: Fits in my pocket, long battery life, spectacular resolution, useful amount of memory,Cons: beveled edge took some getting used to; I kept accidentally selecting things I didn't intend; I resolved the issue when I purchased a cover that wrapped around the sides enough to preclude my accidentally touching the screen, I miss being able to replace my own battery--but I guess those days are long gone, Bixby button and interface--just plain annoyingRead full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,So Far Pretty Good,"I like my phone. Definitely a learning curve as I came from an S6.

Still learning!Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Very happy with my new phone,The price for the phone wasn't bad. It stated in the description that there would be minor scratches or sign of use. There was only a single small scratch on the front of the phone. Other than that it is perfect. I also was given the option to return the phone with in the 1st 30 days no questions asked. I am extremely happy with my purchase.Read full review...,4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great Phone,I love the phone but I still don't like the bixby button. I push it on almost every time I take it out of my pocket. For the retail price (over a 1000 bucks) it is too much. Also Samsung is still notorious for not updating their phones in a timely mannor. I have bought the S series starting with the S 3.Read full review...,4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Not the ideal phone,"The camera is decent and the phone is sleek. However, phone would not stop randomly dailing people every time I close the phone case. Also the swipe keyboard would end up entering some really weird words with numbers in there as if there is no autocorrect function while other times it would autocorrect for me. Certain apps were slow to respond and I was very surprised by this. The weirdest thing of all...the phone cracked without it being dropped.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Some issues but overall a quality phone,"I purchased this phone used so I wasn't expecting a perfect product. The phone has major autofocus issues making the camera almost unusable.  Looking online though, it appears there are many NEW phones that also have this issue, so be wary. There are also spots on the lens so I'm thinking that any dirt that has gotten under the protective glass is what is throwing off the autofocus. For 3 dollars, you can purchase a kit that will allow you to remove the old glass, clean off the lens, then install new glass so I will be doing this to see if this improves the camera.The battery life also has some issues but, with light use and some careful monitoring, you can still get through the day.The screen is beautiful and the phone is very fast making it excellent for browsing, gaming, and multitasking. The speakers are loud and the quality of sound is great, making me question why I bothered purchasing a mini bluetooth speaker to go along with it.Overall, the camera issue is an annoyance but feels salvageable and the rest of the user experience is so positive that it makes the phone totally worth the $280 I spent on it.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Better than the Note 2....but.....,"I am impressed with the quality of the screen and the size. The pre-loaded apps are useful and not useful. Just like any phone, this one has a lot of bloat software. The camera has good images when it focuses on images with distance. If you do deposit checks by phone it is not ideal. The camera more often then not doesn't focus on close images at all. Overall, I would recommend this phone if you are looking for a refurbished phone with decent options. A better camera which focuses closeup would improve it.Read full review...",3
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Note4 Verizon,"Great picture, sound, and a generous 5.7 display with very qualified photography and editing capabilities. If you sketch as I do, the stylus and editing programs provide a digital sketch pad that you can zoom into for high detail work then zoom out for overall additions. Unlike notes priir to/after the 4, this one allows purchase and easy quick battery swaps for endless use. I don't use any of the Samsung specific apps with exception to the keyboard, which is customizable (it's like wallpaper for.ylur keyboard background). With expansion for memory and battery, anyone whim uses their mobile devices for all tasks, this is the handset to get. Sufficed to say that even with new gen. models, this still holds its own to this day. Did I mention that the battery isn't sealed in and can be swapoed out in monents? Get a thick glass protector and case to protect the lightweight aluminum frame and large screen and get to businessRead full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Last Great Samsung,"In my opinion, this is the last great Samsung phone.  I love that I am able to have an external memory card, and removable battery.  I understand that the new Samsungs have fast charging, but I am not always able to be around a phone charger/wall jack for power.  I carry an extra battery with me when I travel, and I am able to do everything I need, and simply swap the battery out when power is low.While I understand that the Note 7 will have the expandable memory, I wish Samsung would listen to its consumers and allow us the choice to have an open back so we can rapidly change our batteries!Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,It'a pretty good phone.,"I've had other Samsungs in the past so there are no particular surprises here (good or bad). It's large by design with a very nice large screen. Performance is pretty good, but there are definitely times where some apps seem to lag a bit. However, some of that could be poor data/network performance. My Verizon coverage isn't the best. Battery life isn't great - I get less than a days use. However, this has been a pattern for me over the years and may also be related to my less than stellar network coverage. Overall this Note 4 and the Galaxy line have worked well for me and multiple family members over the years.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great value for someone who needs a good smartphone!,"It shipped with two batteries and a screen protector was installed. I was thinking that the 2nd battery was used. If it was used I cant tell. It appears that it is a new or like new battery and I think the other battery was new! So with my two batteries and my other two batteries from my previous phone I am in pretty good shape. I also use a battery power case, so I am loaded for bear so to speak with my phone. It was a really good value!!!!Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Good for the price,"I purchased a used phone so I knew the product wouldn't be 100% perfect. Few marks on it, looks almost brand new. The battery life is manageable. Can't use it as often as i would like. The screen and camera (front & back) are excellent. Nice clean pics. Overall satisfied with my purchase.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Not brand new but overall good,"OK so this phone is obviously not new. It has small dings and scratches on the outside. However, it was not pre owned as the imei has never been registered. And it works like new. Which were the two most important factors to me. Don't care much about the cosmetics as long as the damages are only minor, which they are. All in all its a good buy and for the price point, tough to beat. This phone is amazing and I am overall a satisfied customer.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Still a Very Good Phone - 2017,"The Galaxy Note 4 still a good phone to buy at 2017. With Marshmallows 6.0.1 the phone work fast and even has Google Assistant now. Just press and hold the home button to launch GS. Very good camera, beautiful 5.7 Super AMOLED display, SD card slot, removable battery, S Pen, IR blaster for remote control and more... This is really a great phone with internal hardware that still give you a pleasant experience. I really don't have any complain with this phone. If you buy one in very good condition you will have a beautiful phone that will work fast and reliable 99% of the time. Just watch some reviews videos from YouTube and you will see that the majority of people that use it is happy with the Note 4. The best thing is that you can find a good condition N4 for around ~$200. If you looking for a cheap but very good phone, this is one of the best options even if is used. I love my Note 4 and you might love it too.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Grand daddy of  Smart phones,"I owned a Note 2 when it first came out.  Year plus later I damaged the screen.  I reviewed other smart phones before replacing it.  Decided to go with something different.  HTC M one 8. Owned this for several months.  Just never could feel the same level of comfort.  Web surfing not as convenient.  Letters were not as sharp on web sites.  Extremely poor camera.  Camera was a total surprise, because I knew going in Camera was not a strength of that phone. But when  went places (Grand canyon) and saw pictures coming out pathetic, it was disappointing.  Still I was just going to keep the M8.Recently I saw one of my nephews tinkering with his Note 4.  Note 4 appeared way faster and way crisper.  I ordered one on EBay.  Absolutely no regrets.  Best smart phone I have owned so far.Disclaimer:  I have not owned any apple phones so far.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Awesome screen with replaceable battery,"If you want an Android phone with a bigger screen and replaceable battery, this is a great option.  At this point (May 2016) the Note 4 is a good value. If you can find one that is in excellent condition, it's basically the same as the Note 5, but significantly cheaper.  It also has a replaceable battery, unlike the 5.  The battery life is quite good, but it is still the weak link in the system if you use your phone a lot.The phone has a physical ""home"" button, and touch ""back"" and ""view all open Apps"" buttons below the screen.  I was disappointed there's no longer a ""menu"" button as on my old Droid, but all the aps seem to have a good menu button in-screen, so I don't miss it too much.  You can do a split screen with two apps, which is also very nice.And the screen...oh the screen!  This is the moneymaker for this phone.  It is glorious.  It's big (2-3/4"" w x 4-7/8""h), and clear.  I can't even see the individual pixels.  You will never go back to a smaller screen again, but this is probably about as big as is practical.  It fits in my hip pockets, but it sticks out the top.  It also fits in the generous breast pocket of my coveralls, but there is no room to spare.  But for actually using it, it's great.  I have medium sized hands, and I have to work to reach the left side of the keyboard when typing one-handed, but I don't notice it much anymore.  And typing two-handed is a breeze. The haptic feedback is great, and the keyboard finally has the numbers above the QUERTY row, all the time.  You get special characters with a long hold of the keys, which saves having to go to the special character keyboard.  The Swype text input feature works really well, but it takes some practice to get faster than typing just because it's a different input style.The S-pen is a solid feature; I haven't used mine a lot, but it feels like magic watching the cursor appear as you hover over the screen.  Handwriting recognition is pretty good, if you want to be able to have some tablet-like functionality it would probably be great for drawing and such.As a phone, it works great.  When you pull up contacts or recent calls, a swipe to the right will dial the person immediately, without having to go through another confirmation.  It doesn't feel weird holding such a big phone to your ear; it's not like talking on a tablet.If you're considering getting a phone with a bigger screen, just do it.  You will wonder how you ever lived without it, and really, we spend a bit of time on our phones, so you may as well have the biggest screen you can practically haul around.  This is an awesome specimen.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Not functionally worth it,"I charged this Samsung Galaxy Note 4 as if it were a brand new phone, and to my shock it didn't even last all day, I've had it just sitting and not doing nothing with it, I wanted to see what it would do on stand by, I even forced stopped all that I didn't need and uninstalled the game's, I added 5 icons that I use on a daily basis, I did some research on this phone beforehand and it was the camera that sold me on buying it, instead of a $600.00 digital camera, I finally received it on the 5th of April, the post office lost it and had to track it down,  I'm very disappointed in this phone I was hoping to use this phone as my camera on my trip I'm getting ready to take, It was not even worth the time I spent on the research to buy it, I'm so disappointed in this phone, I WILL BE SENDING IT BACK TO THE EBAY STORE I BOUGHT IT FROM.Again this phone has been on stand by all day here are 2 pics so you can see what I'm talking about.Thank you Samsung, I won't be buying any of your phones.Read full review...",2
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Samsungs last great phone.,"At first the size was a little much for me but it grew on me as soon as I used the S7 and texting on the small screen was a pain. Now I love this phone.  Removable battery and addable storage  makes it samsungs last great device.  The S7 was touted as having the best camera with zero lag and super fast focus, and it was. Until the updates kept rolling in and then trying to get a good picture to focus was like using an old S3. The note 4 so far has a great camera and I have no issue with focusing.  Battery life drops quick but all samsungs do. It has a fast charger and easily swapable batteries so it isn't bad.  Anyone looking for replacement batteries try Anker. Those are some of the best aftermarket ones.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great Phone,"I absolutely love my note 4, Yes it is big, but that is how I wanted it, a large crystal clear display, lots of functions, and enough to keep you entertained for hours upon hours, I would suggest a good gorilla glass hard full body case to protect it, especially if you do mechanic or construction work, I have mine in a metal gorilla glass case that i could drop it off a building, and it would still work and not have a scratch on the phone, it comes with a fast lightning speed charger, and when fully charged, the battery usually last about 2 days, sometimes 3, just depends on how much you use it or stay on it, bottom line, Yes I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a large displayed phone with a good camera and a tone of options, I like it better than my S4, Hope this review helps you decide.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,PHONE ONLY WORKS FOR 15 MIN!!!,"Was really happy when the phone a Galaxy Note 4 I ordered arrived.. Couldn't afford a brand new one so settled with a refurbished model instead.. Birthday present to myself.. So when I got it everything was included and the phone was in really good condition.. Charged it up, turned it on, then headed out to meet up with friends.. Ten minutes later I arrived to my spot and heard the phone beeping so I looked thinking it was an SMS... No SMS the beeping was the low battery alerting me I only have 20% battery.. REALLY!! After charging it for 3to4 hours!! Needless to say the phone was dead 5 min later and I was pissed.. Really awesome celebrating my 40th birthday with a phone that doesn't work because the battery is a POS!! I'm still pissed off!! Other than the battery not working the phone seems to work fine, Soo far.. I guess im going to have to shell out $30- $40 bucks for new battery and keep this one plugged in in the meantime.. Very unsatisfied!! Only gets 2 - Stars for is lack of longevity... Would get 5 Stars if the battery worked!!Read full review...",2
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Samsung Note 4 -  AT&T,"This is an excellent device that has everything I need and more. The large screen may take most people (myself included) a little while to get used to at first. Especially if you're coming from a much smaller iPhone or Android. But you won't look back once you have a chance to adjust to all beautiful bright and vivid screen real estate. Pictures on a 16mgpx camera come out stunning and zooming in to crop does not reveal much if any distortion. I chose this Note 4 device over the newer Note 5 because this one has a removable battery and upgradeable memory card (up to 128gb). Unfortunately Samsung decided to leave out this functionality in all of its premium hero phones for 2015 and instead shifted to a unibody  design, much like all iPhones. My hope is that 2016 will mark the return of removable batteries and memory cards to Samsung premium devices. You won't be disappointed in the Note 4 and I highly recommend this as the phone to buy right now. It is the same exact screen size as the Note 5 and has the same camera resolution as well. It also supports the rapid charge feature, which means you can get a battery from 0 to 50% in about 30 minutes or less. Dollar for dollar, it's the best premium phone money can buy today, period.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,GREAT camera everything else is not so good.,Like the title says... GREAT rear facing camera! Does amazing photos even in low light but everything else about this phone is just.... I wouldn't buy it again I'll say that. The phone has multi-tasking capabilities but loves to freeze up or bog down. I've had to take the battery out at least 7 times since owning this phone. It just stops responding to all key in puts and button function. When it's running good it can be a fun experience but that's not often.Read full review...,3

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Galaxy Note 4,This is an excellent device it does everything a smartphone should do. It has everything the standard size smartphone has plus a stylus which allows me to enter via handwriting (the handwriting to text is just great) as well as point to exactly where I want to go unlike my finger. The larger screen is also nice. But the stylus is a game changer. I chose this model over the Note 5 because I can add an MicroSD card for my pictures and videos. I download movies to watch on a plane.This smartphone is what the iphone is striving for but will never reach.Read full review...,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,The best value of all the Samsung Note 4s.,"I bought this to replace my wife's Note 4 that was originally a Verizon unlocked phone that we bought used. We were using it on an AT&T network, and although it worked it had spotty 4G LTE reception and issues with having to have to take it to AT&T to have it reset for their network every time there was an upgrade and it wouldn't upgrade to Android 6.0 on the AT&T network. This Note 4 for AT&T now works perfectly on the AT&T network.She takes a lot of pictures and video and travels so an external SD card and replaceable battery is a must. I offered to get her an LG V10 like my phone or a V20 but she likes her Note 4. I bought a new Note 4 for AT&T in the box with all the accessories unopened for 303 dollars. What a deal. It has a really good camera, and  the Gorilla Glass 4 screen is tough as nails. She had the other Note 4 for two years and the screen was like new.When you consider how the average user will gain with a new LG V20 or comparable phone and the Note 7 is extinct and the Note 5 was a step backwards, the 400 dollars that you save over a current model phone makes the Note 4 a real bargain, if a great 5.7 inch phone is what you want. Plus you have the option of the stylus if that is important to you. Battery life is about the same as any phone. If you are just using it as a phone the battery lasts a day and a half. If you are on it constantly then you need an extra battery, external power or put it on the charger to make it through the day.If you need to shoot 4K video or be able to shoot photos and have a RAW dng file to work from then you need to look to the Premium LG phones or other 4K and RAW capable phones, but if JPGs straight out of the camera and 1080P Full HD video is all you need then this fills the bill very well.For the audiophiles out there, if you like to Rip FLAC files from your CDs it will play them. The speaker is about average for a cell phone. Only so much that you can do with these small speakers. The internal DAC seems to be quite capable. It drives headphones and feeds our cars radio line in quite well. True audiophiles will probably want to look to the LG V10 with it's two high quality audio DACs or the V20 with it's 4 DAC system.In summary this a great phone that will fill the needs of most users. It has a very high quality AMOLED screen that displays content with rich vivid colors, but in all fairness to readers of this review my wife and grandson, who has a Samsung S7 edge both complain about having difficulty seeing the screen in certain bright outdoor settings, so this may be a drawback to Samsung's AMOLED screens as I don't have that difficulty with my LG V10's IPS screen.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Lovin it!,"The last of the Note series to include a replaceable battery.  Long battery life too.   The screen on this phone is incredible and so clear that when Iphone users see pics on this screen, they invariably say, ""My, it's so clear!""Get a new one while you can.  Watch out for refurbished ones.  I tried that route, and sent it back for a new one, albeit, from a different and excellent seller!  What a truly awesome phone.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great little sketching device.,"It's my favorite in your pocket sketching device, the wacom technology in the s-pen makes for tight, fluid lines when coupled with adobe sketcher. It's a bit large, and the battery isn't as long lasting as I'd like, and the screen burns in if left on the brightest setting for too long, but damn is it a good device for quick little sketches. It's also the last Note Samsung released that the battery is easy to replace and has a micro sd card slot, well, besides the newest Note. But that goes for way more money.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Love my Note 4,"I bought a used Note 4.  It had a few scratches, but everything seems to work great.  I love the large size of the screen, it makes it easier to type with my big fingers.  This gets a signal when my old core prime would not.  I really like the finger print reader to sign in easy and keep people out.  It also communicates well with the Sony Stereo in my F150.  Since it was used I bought a new replacement battery that has more power.  The old one lasted longer then the one on my old phone, but this will last me the whole time I am at work.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Love my Note4!,"I had to replace my Samsung Note 4 after accidentally getting my last Note 4 wet.  My prior one had been doing just fine prior to that and I'd had it since 2014.  These are great phones, and one of the few smart phones that still allow you to a) access your SIM card, b) add and access your SD card (so far I've had a 64 GB SD, but it may be capable of larger, not sure), and c) use a wired headset.  Hence the reason for my replacing it with this one, which as FANTASTIC as it was literally like new (came in the box with the plastic still on the screen, and everything a new Note 4 comes with in the box).  It was like getting a new Note 4 for a quarter of the price.  Thank you!!!Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Still a great phone,"For years I have purchased the newest & greatest smartphones right when they came out. My last one was so good, I broke the trend and kept it for 3 1/2 years - and then purchased a Galaxy Note 4. It's a big phone; big in the pocket, big in the hand - this size may not be for everyone. I'm liking the screen size & the quality is fantastic. Removeable battery and micro-sd slot were important to me (the Note 5 does not have either). Good battery life and fast charging works amazingly well - easily adds 50% to your battery in about 30 minutes.Mine upgraded to Android 6 (I'm on AT&T).

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Powerhouse and good value.,"The priorities for me when I bought this phone were as follows:-longer battery life-processor speed-good to great camera-great screen-large screen-SD card slot-Removable/changeable batteryThe battery lasts longer than most.  It's pretty powerful, though sometimes it does lag when bringing up a new app for the first time.  Screen is beautiful.  Stylus is pressure sensitive and works very well.  The S-health suite of apps is actually very good and comprehensive, helping me with diet, activity and sleep.  The case is not as nice as some of the newer designs.  However this design allows for a removable back with access to an SD card and the battery.  So can increase memory and swap a dead battery for a new one.  The IR blaster works well.  The camera works very well in adequate light.  It is not quite as good in low light settings unless you can hold the camera very still and nothing is moving.  If I had to make a purchase of a new phone today, the chances are very good I would still choose this one.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Very decent phone with some minor issues,"Overall, I really like the phone . It is fast ,it performs well and has some very nice features that one would expect  in a flagship  model  phone. Before  I  got  this phone, I had an LG G4 that crapped out after 4 months. I have  had this one for a couple  of weeks  now and so far am happy  with it . There is one issue  I have noticed about my Note 4. It is constantly  doing updates  , like every  day . I took it to Verizon  and they told me it was a glitch  with the phone.  No really big deal,  I just set it for the next day at 5 AM when I'm still sleeping.  I figure I can tolerate  that until they find a fix for the glitch. If this is as good a phone as I have read in other reviews,  then I think I can deal with that. Other than that , it seems to be a great phone even by today's  standard.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,nothing better,"there is nothing better on the market than this note 4. it's screen matches anything out there. it is bright and as detailed as it gets. no phone beats its screen. the battery is removable. just buy a new one and you are good to go. no need to send it in to get it replaced at who knows what cost? and time to get it back?  it has a pen. use it how you want. don't have one? can't use this awesome piece of technology. it has an excellent camera. the selfie camera is only 3.5, but easily sufficient. want to pay 2-3 times as much? buy the note 7 or an s7. this note 4 matches those at a great savings. i could have bought the note 7 or some other product, but no. this note 4 has been the best and still is. i am one happy bird.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Very powerful and fast unit. Love playing games, watching movies and browsing internet with it.","Always loved Samsung products. This is by far the best one.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Easy to Use,Love everything about this phone.   Great size and has many choices to help personalize to your taste.   Also love the note.  So handy.,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Nice phone,"Very happy with this phone.  Very SLIM, yes.  ""Form factor"" used as a description of a cellphone is sort of a mis-used term reserved for desktop computers, not for cellphones.  But sellers often use this phrase to describe their product and to help it sell better. That being said, this cellphone worked just fine for me.  I have a TON of apps on it so I'm not able to reliably speak towards battery life, unfortunately.  I've got about a hundred different apps loaded and my batteries lose about 50-percent inside a couple hours.  I have radar apps and other apps which run in the background often constantly, so my phone is being used like a tool nearly always active.  But for what it is designed to do, the phone works quite nicely for me.  I am very happy with it.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Nice update to previous Samsung models.,"This phone is a bit heavier than the S6 Plus I previously owned.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Awesome Phone!,"I love this phone.  I keep cell phones a long time and the only reason I had to get a new one is because of Verizon dropping CDMA at the beginning of 2020.  My old Galaxy S4 didn't have the capability of transmitting voice over LTE so it had to go.The S9+ is a much better phone.  I love being able to see the screen in broad daylight!  I never knew what I was taking a photo of with the S4 because the screen was impossible to see in sunlight.  Also this new phone is much faster, and the phone audio is much, much better quality.  For one thing, it's full duplex so when the person you're talking to says something at the same time you do, you can both still hear each other.  It's just like the old landlines were.  And the sound quality is so good it sounds like the person is right next to you.And with the octacore processor it's much, much faster than the old quadcore s4 was.There's not much to dislike with this phone.  The only complaint I have is the volume button being opposite the power button.  When I'm blanking out the screen or turning the phone off I often change the volume at the same time, but that's just a habit I need to get break.Overall, I couldn't be happier with this phone.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Great value, great product!",We love the phones! So much nicer than our last Samsung phone. The battery life is much better and we love the features!,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Great phone for the price, trustworthy company. Very happy with my purchase.","After almost a month of it, I loved it. It is a good value for it, especially comparing it to the newer phones, it's a great choice. I have had no problems with it since. Device came clean and with no scratches or dents or any other cosmetic damages, it was practically brand new.It came in a day early, so it was a welcomed surprise. I use a 15 watt Qualcomm supported quick charger, which works with my phone so it charges fast and I don't run into problems with battery life at all.However, after a recent drop, from I want to say no more than 2 or 3 ft a portion of the screen is cracked. I don't blame the company selling this product at all since it was my mistake. Samsungs claims of tough screens don't always hold up. Screen protectors are important to buy. I will be buying another device from this company after the drop since the glass pertrudes because I trust them, and I know I will be getting what I wanted.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Better battery was my final decision. ,I think its a great phone and the battery life is the reason why I chose it over the s9 was the extra battery size.  If the s9 would have had the extra battery as does the s9 plus I would have ordered the smaller profiled phone for its convenience to fit into my front pocket more comfortably.  But I have found the extra screen size enjoyable when watching videos and reading.  Great looking phone.  Read full review...,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,A great phone,The SG9+ Is a great phone in all departments. I love it. It came with a case and protect plastic film that goes over the display screen. The USB A to C cable that came with the phone was junk and would not charge or transfer data to the phone. It took me a couple of days to figure out that the cable was no good. I purchased a new cable and this solved my problem.Read full review...,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Really nice phone - incredible photos,"The 9 Plus is a bigger phone than I'm used to, but I got the benefit of that the other day as I used it to watch a film - no longer do I need to take a tablet for this purpose (I have a laptop for work).  The camera is incredible.  The phone was unlocked as expected (all Verizon phones are still unlocked - this reportedly will change soon).   In the UK, I was able to swap in a Vodafone SIM and get full 4G speeds cheaply.  Very happy with this phone!Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great value considering cost through Verizon,"I wanted to try purchasing a phone outside of Verizon's contracts.  This phone was $180 less than Verizon's price.  It's brand new.  So far, I have no complaints.  I would not say it has a long battery life as I have to charge it daily, by evening the battery is down in the 20% range.  And I am not on it all day.  I do not do video or talk much on it.  I also purchased wireless chargers for it, which I love.  One is a case that I keep with me in event I have to use the phone extensively, it would need to be recharged.  The size of the screen is sufficient while not being overly bulky.  Fits nicely in my purse.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Horrible reception. Equally bad audio.,"I couldn't get more than two bars on it. Even within sight of a cell tower. almost always 1 bar or nothing. When it did have a call make it through, the people on the other end could never hear me unless i put them on speaker. The rest of the smart phone type stuff that uses internet, it does just fine as long as its connected to WiFi. If you like having to go outside to get better reception, and only use speakerphone or Bluetooth then this is the phone for you. The very fist call I made with it was dropped. It couldn't make or take a decent call for me and I returned it after a couple days.Read full review...",2
Cell Phones & Smartphones,I am glad I bought this phone,"I've been wanting to upgrade my Galaxy S5 for quite a while but haven't wanted to spend the money to get a new phone. I found this S7 and was pleased with the under $200 price tag. So, I decided to take the plunge. Over all I have been pleased with this phone. I don't think the battery life is much better then my S5 but I am not going to complain. It took a bit for all the updates to get done but I guess that is what is expected. The only physical defect that I can see on the phone is a bit of a scratch on the front power button. Other then that, I wouldn't have known that this was a refurbished phone. I did have to replace my SIM card as my S5's was to large but that wasn't a big deal. I am pleased that the S7 has a spot for extending the memory and was able to transfer pics and my music with the memory.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great Phone with a Crappy Battery,"Great phone. Absolutely beautiful. Very responsive. Flexible. It's large, but then I came from an iphone 5s which is quite small, so maybe it just seems big. My only gripe is that the battery life is terrible. It can barely make it through the day even if I hardly use it. And charging with anything other than the fast charger pod they give you is glacial.The camera is excellent, but the stock photo app produces highly over-processed results. I installed ""Open Camera"" and the photos are outstanding, so the hardware is excellent. Verizon adds too much shovelware, but I deal with most of it by moving it to the Verizon folder which I never use. Apps are quick, responsive, and a pleasure to use and the external SD card greatly expands the available space on the device.All in all, this is a fantastic phone. If it weren't for the battery life, I'd give it 5 stars.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Good phone, good value :)","Very happy with this phone so far. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I don't know if it is brand new like it said. It came and it had the protection stickers like it should but the back one said something like replacement sticker in small print. But heard of others getting there phones with scratches or the sound not working which that was my fear, but externally It does look brand new and Internally I have not noticed any issues so far.  Was a good price compared to purchasing brand new at verizon or something. So far, I am happy with it!Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Excellent Value Samsung Galaxy phone,"This Galaxy S7 smartphone unit is a good value for the price I paid.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Works OK.,"Well, I wanted a gold color phone and this one works OK.

Still, I prefer the Samsung brand above all others.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Galaxy S7 - Great Phone with a Terrible Battery,"This is a great phone.  I recently upgraded from a SIII to a family leftover S5.  I wanted a newer generation phone but didn't want to pay the crazy prices for a new phone.  I use PagePlusCellular so I have to bring my own phone.  The phone was relatively easy to set up, but you have to have access to WiFi to do that, you can't set it up without a connection to the internet.  You need a special tool to open the SIM card slot, which is not included, but you can use the end of a paperclip so not getting the tool will not prevent you from getting that slot open.  The battery life is terrible.  I fully charged it, I've had it sitting here for about 4 hours and it is already down to 86%.  I also was told the unit I bought used was in very good condition, but it turns out it is in excellent condition, so I got a really great deal.  I would not hesitate to recommend this phone.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Shipped rapidly and works great!!,"Brand new, easy st up and works well,  I took it to the Sprint store and they put in a SIM card, and connected my number to it.  I took it home and used ""Smart Switch"" to move all my  contacts, videos and pictures to  it and installed my  old Micro SD card and apps.   I would love to have an S20 Elite, but am not willing to pay the additional $1,800 for the better camera.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Note 4 to S7 Edge,Because of the size it was hard for me to switch from the Note 4 to the S7 Edge. Also the fact that if anything went wrong I could take out my battery in the Note 4. The battery in the S7 Edge does not come out. It does have a place for an SD card I do like that. Just hard to change from a larger size to a smaller size.Read full review...,4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Good phone, good value & good seller!","Bought this Galaxy S7 from 57jewels as a replacement for my old Galaxy S3. The S3 served me well for 6 years & still looked like new, but it now longer had enough RAM or internal memory to work well with all the apps I regularly use. The S7 is a great improvement, much faster and plenty of internal storage and RAM for everything I use. I had always bought the latest & greatest Samsung before, but just didn't want to pay the price for an S9 (or even an S8). Other than a little worn paint on the home button, this used S7 looks as good as new. And other than a few camera tweaks, the S7 still functions nearly as well as the latest models (at less than a quarter of the cost by buying EUC).Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Great size, plus you can use and SD card!",The Samsung Galaxy S7 packs everything I want!  I get a larger capacity battery with a smaller size phone and the ability to use an micro SD card too.  So what's not to love?  It's just a tad bigger than an S4.  Like any new phone it takes some getting used to because the phone works a tad differently than my old Samsung but overall very happy with the purchase and highly recommend.Read full review...,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great Phone,"I was thinking of buying a ""mid-range"" phone, but with Samsung's former flagship S7 being more than a year old it can be had at reasonable prices.  The main thing I did not like about the mid-range phones is the camera quality.  In doing my research I found that the best cameras are on the ""flagship"" phones like the S7.  I am thrilled with my S7, and its camera.  It is slim compared to many phones out there now, and I have phone that was ""cutting edge"" just about 1 1/2 years ago and that meets my needs, especially for under $300 brand new on Ebay.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,BUY FROM THESE FOLKS YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG,"I purchased this refurbish phone and I have to say this is the best phone I have had. Beats paying those super high prices for new ones. I have been forced to learn a lot about cell phone because I live in a rule area and I do not want to be locked down by one carrier.I will say this for which consumers have no idea about. When you purchase a phone you need to know that even through it may be an unlocked phone, if it has ever been connected to a net work then it is fully NOT unlocked and never will be. Networks burn there information into the phone that can not be removed or wiped cleaned.The other thing you need to know is very important, know the reversion of the phone especially the android version and the Samsung version. This make all the difference in the world. Now cellular company will not be able to tell you unless the pick up the very phone they are sending to you and look at it. If is not ever in there description.With this company they some how did it, so I received a phone with a 8.0 Android and a 9.0 Samsung version. And by far this phone is three times faster than my old S7 and better reception for where I live.These people are awesome to work with and the price was unbeatable for the product I purchased. Plus with the guarantee and they have a very good support line too.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Galaxy S7 is a cost effective upgrade from the S5,"Great phone at a good price now that the 8s and 9s have been released.  Battery lasts a good 16 hours plus in mid power efficiency mode and upwards of 27 hours in high efficiency mode.  High efficiency can be limiting if not rooted but it's manageable.  Most days mid gets the job done, but if battery is running low (say 5 hours at 25% remaining) high efficiency mode will extend it another 10 hours.  Was hesitant about getting the S8 due to the curved screen, I noticed a lot of cracked S8 screens on eBay auctions.  A regular slim silicon case protects this phone very well.  All in all I am very satisfied moving from the S5 to the S7.  Camera is FAR superior to the S5.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"lightweight, easy to use, looks like new","I upgraded from a Samsung S5 to S7.  Had to go to a Verizon store for a new SIM card because these are not interchangeable.  Also, upgraded to more memory.  The apps start much faster and can switch from one to another without a long pause.  The battery still only lasts about 16 hours but I think the garmin app drains the battery.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great smart phone,"This cell phone seems to be a great smart phone.Powers up fast, quite good battery life, and,it functions super good as a phone!Wife had an LG G3 for over 3 years, this is an upgrade!She likes it alot.  Value wise, way better than the newestgeneration of phones, (like less than half as much for nearlythe same functions).  Near water proof (5' for 30 mins).Many cases for low $$ and tempered glass screen protecters2 for $9.00.I would say it was a good buy.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Came in great shape.,"No cracks, phone was clean and came with a charger, the charging speed was on the slower side, but had a Samsung block already.

Had it activated with a Verizon tower through straighttalk same day.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"It's a pretty, intelligent phone. Very cool in design","It's has a lot of cool tricks and quirks. It's water proof and the look is impeccable. I have the pink gold one btw. The phone is better than apple in design, and gimmicks. It will never keep you bored. The only thing is to make sure you get a screen and phone protector being that it is glass all over, surrounding a thin layer of metal; so it can easily get cracked if it fell on asphalt or concrete for that matter. It's much better than iPhones and worth the switch.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Affordable replacement for broken phone,Rather than expensive monthly insurance with carrier for replacing the occasional lost or broken phone. This is a better way to go.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,S7 can be had for a low price and does all you need,This S7 is a new build of an old model. The battery needs charging every day sometimes more than once. Other than that it does everything I need and due to the fact that it's not the latest model it is relatively cheap. This is important because I tend to break my phone's a lot LOLRead full review...,4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Need to add a case because the phone is too slick to hold, features are many.","Only thing I can say, the product has Samsung quality. No, I don't like the size but until a good flip-phone comes back on the market, it well have to do.",3
Cell Phones & Smartphones,My New/Old Galaxy S7,"I love this phone, my original one I killed with a faulty wire, I did NOT want any of the other new phones, not only because they are outragely expensive, but they are getting so complecated as well, and BIGGER!I might as well take my tablet with me if I wanted a huge cell phone!So I found this and it's perfect. The battery life is not great, not sure if the apps are consuming it, but twice a day I need a full charge. And the ""small form factor"" I'm guessing asks how big the phone is, and it's perfect for smaller hands. I will not add pictures, you can google them, it's a Samsung Galaxy S7 in gold.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Very small imperfections, but still a good phone!","Although the phone was refurbished, it almost looks and works like new. There are a few scratches but it's not noticeable unless you're really looking hard at the phone. The phone works smoothly, the only down side is that the phone's battery life is slightly above average and it overheats if too many apps are open or are in use. Otherwise, this is a good price for this phone! Since I've already got a distinct case and screen protector on the phone, I cannot post any pictures; but the phone basically looks like how it does in the provided pictures.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Love it!,It was in excellent physical condition as advertised. No sim card so I had to purchase one to activate but I guess that is normal.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Samsung phones not that great,I took the phone out of the box & couldn't charge it. The charge port was packed with lint. I had to remove it all with a needle.

I went to register Galaxy S7 with Samsung and  Samsung said phone only had one month left on warranty.  Somebody had already registered phone with Samsung a year earlier.  No big deal, just be aware.  Overall, I'm happy with phone otherwise.  Appears to have all factory/OEM parts.

But there is some wear on the bottom that seller didn't mention, but that's fine. It can be seen in the pic that seller provide. Alright.. still can tolerate. The phone works pretty well. I quit samsung after I using S5, cuz it's very slow. But S7e build my confidence towards samsung again. Very fluently. Battery is durable too.In a word, I like it.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Wife likes her new toy.,"There are some issues with the phone, but overall it's fine. We have some connection issues, but I am not sure it is because of the phone or carrier. The phone's physical shape was good, not showing much wear.

This one is much better, and cheaper to boot.Read full review...",3
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Great features, good battery life, works well on wifi and mobile data","I bought this as an upgrade to my Galaxy S5.  It has considerable more battery life, and I find it gets a stronger signal on wifi and more bars on cell that other phones.  For the money, this is a great buy.  When I compared technical specs, there weren't quantum improvements in the S8 or S9 to justify the extra money.  Note that I do use a real DSLR with multiple lenses for photos, so ALL cell phones and tablets are just toys when it comes to taking pics, but I find the S7 does a good job here for a camera without a real lens.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Great features, worth the money!","I purchased this phone after many reviews on Youtube and a bad experience with a different retailer. This phone is worth the extra money and has all the bells and whistles. Performs much faster than my s4 that i had and with no hiccups. It takes great pictures, long battery life and lots of cool features that you wouldn't expect. I didn't know there was an option for HD voice until i got this phone, and the calls come in crystal clear like the person is right next to you. It was in excellent condition when i got it. If you're looking to make an upgrade but don't want to shell out $1000 for a phone, this is definitely worth the investment.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Worth the price of upgrade from S3,"I used a Samsung Galaxy S3 for years and found it very serviceable.  I finally decided that it was time to upgrade and chose the S7 because the S8s were so expensive by comparison.  So far, I have not been disappointed.Pros:  Nice look.  Good fit and finish.  Great reception.  Much better battery life than the S3.Cons:  SIM/SD card tray is not as robust as I'd like.  Even if the battery's useful life is greater than my older phones, the sealed back will make its eventual replacement tedious or more expensive.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Perfect For Me, Extremely Satisified","I wanted the upgrades available on the Samsung 10; and was also considering the Samsung 9.  But I just wasn't thrilled to make the footprint any larger than Galaxy 6 & 7.  As a man, without a purse, the larger screens, though nice, just are to wieldy for daily carry.  The Samsung 10e is the perfect phone.  It retains the smaller, yet large enough screen size..actually being larger due to lack of space wasted around the borders, bottom and top.  You get the faster processor, 6 GB or RAM, the stereo speakers, the dual lens back camera, and more internal memory while still allowing expansion with a micro SD card.  I took the plunge and am so thrilled with the improvements, to include stronger cellular signal which was good with my S6, but not so good with my S7.  And, I got a break on the price of a 'white' phone which gives a very clean silver/white sheen and is great too!Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,All of the hardware upgrades in a more compact package.,"The Galaxy s10e is a premium product.  Its just as good as the other s10 models.  You forgo a camera on the front and back (which you don't need anyways) the fingerprint scanner on the screen (its on the power button) and you forgo a bigger battery due to the smaller display.  You get an 8 core cpu, 6GB ram, 128GB storage all in a compact package.  I think the battery is 3100 units which is the only real downside of opting for this smaller package, but it lasts incredibly long to me.Read full review...",5

I must say that I am pleased with the overall decision. This phone has great battery life often lasting a full day on a single charge, lightweight and has a bright screen just to name some of the really great features.The only con is, with an unlocked phone on the Verizon network, 4G is no longer and option and only the base line LTE is available leading to no coverage or dropped calls in otherwise great service areas.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Excellent fun to use with issues.,Galaxy Note 10 is an excellent phone but not perfect.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Worth the get!,"The product came a bit early, but overall it was worth the get. I got everything included which was the phone, headphones,the stylus pen, the key to putting the sim card, charger, and USB c to USB b converter. The phone has a pre-built screen protector so I didn't have to worry about getting one. If you can get this phone, I would do so.

The packing was not as I expected (not the normal version that you see on the web); and that made me doubt and question if the product was original, I checked the IMEI and everything is fine, it¬¥s a SPRINT phone and maybe that¬¥s why the packing was different. So far the phone has run quite nice.Read full review...",4

Another important thing that I found is that, by using Switch, you can import your notes from an old Galaxy Note 3,4 or 5 phone into your newer version of the Notes App in the Android 10 version and even being able to draw by hand like you would with an S-Pen in the Note.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,What you see is what you get,"It has almost unnoticeable signs of use. I feel it was a display item because the screen when it has white color shows light traces of home screen menu. But in general it is as good as new. Being from Verizon, it comes with some preinstalled apps that can be disabled. Every time you restart it, you will see a notification that reads the sim is not from Verizon. The Hotspot option (using your mobile as a Wifi router - which is rarely used or even known to people) will not work. Check prices if you can save on a brand new, then it is recommended.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Unusable,"Received a refurbished phone supposedly in ""B+"" condition.  It freezes every time I try to access the phone from the lock screen and has restarted itself every ten minutes since I started it up.  Its just plain unusable and unsatisfactory. The only pro for this phone is that it takes great pictures, when it doesn't freeze or lock up.Read full review...",2
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Very good phone,"When I got the phone it was overheating and the battery was dying to fast. Once I got a new battery the phone stopped overheating and works as if it was brand new, the screen however didn't have  any scratches as described in description it look brand new. Overall I'm very happy with productRead full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Straight talk starter kit.,"The straight talk starter kit that came with the phone was not valid; I had to pay for a valid starter kit directly from straight talk which took another ten days to receive in the mail. Once I got the valid kit, imported my number, and got the phone up and running it worked (and still is working), great. Had the starter kit that came with the phone worked I would have been up and working 10 days sooner.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Unbelievable features, sensors, display and battery life","It's been six years since my last 'mobile' phone purchase and the technology has become unbelievable. From Finger print scanner, barometric pressure, UV, Heart Rate, SpO2, Tri-band GNSS, stereo microphones, stereo speakers, 3.2Ah battery, Wireless Charging, Bluetooth Low Energy, WiFi, HotSpot, HDVoice, VoWiFi, 200GB SDXC, and I just found a button on the S-Pen stylus! The 16mb front camera takes incredible photos with embedded GEO information and the ability to use the S-Pen to crop and send the image in an instant. I haven't made it to the back camera yet, not a real selfie type person. After receiving the phone I plugged the SIM card in and it installed the latest Android version while I poured coffee. Learning Marshmallow has been painless between the training videos at Verizon and Samsung. Figuring out what I really wanted on the phone and how to make it work so the battery would last two days took some tinkering.Best of I saved $500 buying used but the real reason was there isn't another phone with these features for sale, yet.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Good solid phone..you will want the battery power case +-$25.,I thought this phone looked slick with the rounded edge and additional apps icons area on the edge..and it looks and works very well!!I also have a Galaxy S5 which I like as well.The Edge is just a bit clumsy to handle..not as comfortable as the S5. Also if you are working on something on the main screen and a call comes in..the screen does not default to the incoming call so you can clearly see who is calling..instead it displays on the small edge screen making it difficult to see who is calling..That is my main complaint and that may be changeable in the settings..I don't know..ByronRead full review...,4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Awesome cell phone.,I love the Sasung Galaxy Note Brand. I purchased this cell from third party and I am pleased. My Note 5 went swimming so I needed a cell.

They are better than the iPhone also.Read full review...,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great phone,Last year I bought the S6 Edge but I originally wanted the note edge but they had stopped making them. So I found it online and I love it!

I can see at a glance my favorite and often used programs without having to go to ""apps"" and search through endless icons.  I also love the ""pen"" feature.  I loved it so much I bought one for my Mom for her Birthday.  She is still learning how to use it (a big step up from her iPhone 4).  Her comment was it has ""so many"" programs.  That it does.  The battery life isn't that great and that is it's only drawback but I purchased an extended battery here on Ebay and now I can go two days without having to charge it.  I am very happy with my purchase.  I LOVE my new phone.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Great phone, glad I upgraded from Samsung.S5 to Samsung S8","This was my upgrade from a Galaxy S5 to the Galaxy S8. The Samsung ""Smart Switch"" helped considerably in the transfer from the S5 to the S8. Much improved phone. Only short coming is the weaker signal strength from the smaller (nano) SIM card. The optional WIFI phone/text transmission mitigated that problem. Much improved audio and camera. I hope the non-replaceable battery lasts as long as the replaceable batteries in the S5. Much more user friendly operating system. A lot to learn. I would do this again.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,My first unlocked phone.,"I like it.  I popped in my SIM and It works, but WI-FI calling does not.  Very annoying since that's supposed to be a T-Mobile staple, I get zero reception at work, and it worked fine on my old Galaxy S5.  In my research to fix the problem I found out that cell companies will disable that feature if your BYOD phone is unlocked and not branded for their network.Read full review...",3
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Love my Samsung S8!,"I really love this Samsung S8.  It is sleek, easy to use, and looks great with a nice display.  Photos and videos are excellent.  I am surprised that the battery doesn't last as long as expected -- I have to charge it after a few hours -- but the charging is very, very fast.  I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend this phone.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Not really a 4 out of 5 -- 8/10 as advertised,This Galaxy S8 was advertised as a 4 out of 5.  Besides a condition of 8/10. The phone itself looks great but it it very disappointing on how it drains on very little usage . I guess on a refurb ed phone you do not know about the quality of the battery. I expect they fully charged before mailing but it arrived at 47%. From there I noticed immediately even though I have my phone turned off at night - upon starting a d checking my mail the phone loses about 10% right away. It drops to below 50% by late afternoon with minimal amount of surfing from home. It also came with LCD screen burn at bottom of phone and no mention of that on the website regarding this particular phone.The S8 galaxy is suppose to be a long lasting battery but that is not my experience even with power saving &  all the other recommendations of putting apps to sleep when not in use.Read full review...,3

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Best value iPhone X 256G,Fast service and best value !!!  Switched from a 5s to a iPhone X with lots of memory. SIM card fit and start up software was simple. Backup your old phone on iCloud and keep it close to your new phone. Software uses Bluetooth and WiFi to do the rest. Did it all myself without tech support.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"It's a REAL beautiful, lovely little iPhone...","It's a REAL beautiful, lovely little iPhone, absolutely, no question!But is it WORTH the totally OBSCENE amount of money that Apple is asking (new and pre-owned, both)?Absolutely not. By no stretch of the imagination is this smartphone THAT much more superior to other smartphones.My wife wanted only this particular phone, so we bought it for her (""Happy Wife = a Happy Life"").  But it is, in all honesty, ridiculously overpriced and over-hyped. In my honest opinion.  Best of luck to you with your decision...Read full review...",3

There are some things that haven‚Äôt been addressed yet, like the compatibility of some apps with the new screen, or the absence of multitasking, but overall it‚Äôs a very smooth experience. I do not like the price tag though. If you can get a deal, you might be able to shave about $150 from the full retail price. Absolutely recommended. Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Overall a great Phone  ,I bought the I Phone X out of the box. It had some barley noticeable imperfections on the screen. It was easy to set up and has a great display.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,The New iPhone X,"I was skeptical at first but the longer I have it, the better it gets. Facial ID set up in less than 30 seconds. The phone is blinding fast. Apple somehow figured out how to increase volume across the board so that is much better than my 7+. Battery life is better, too. After getting used to not having a control button, which didn‚Äôt take long at all, navigation is a snap. All in all, this is a phone that I can hold onto for a while - can‚Äôt imagine what‚Äôs coming next but I‚Äôll be enjoying the X for months to come. I highly recommend the iPhone X.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Worth the wait,"I had the iPhone 6s Plus before this bad boy. Although that phone was awesome, I'm glad I upgraded to the X. Went from a 64gb storage to 256gb. Happy to have purchased  a year after the release, as I got it heavily discounted on cyber Monday. Camera takes fast and clear photos, battery life is decent, and face ID is better than I thought it would be. The jury is still out on True Tone display but getting used to leaving that feature on, as it actually does help with reducing eye strain. I bought this phone refurbished in overall good condition. The back is made out of glass and was scratched a bit, so I bought a carbon fiber decal cutout, now looks like new.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Cannot hear on this phone,"I am not sure what to do- the phone‚Äôs volume is terrible. We bought two, and the phone‚Äôs speakers just can NOT be heard by either me or my husband.  We both can hear SOOO much better out of our iPhone 6. I am slightly hearing impaired, but even my husband, who hears well, has trouble hearing out of this phone, and it has no audio output jack to plug it into our (old-Bluetooth less) car or our portable speaker, so that it can be heard. Talking on the phone, or listening to a show or radio is a total exercise in frustration on this phone- I am sorely disappointed  :(.Read full review...",2

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Best camera, computer, phone, screen you can hold in your hand...in the WORLD!","I've never seen a better screen with such rich, true-to-life colors than what I've seen on the iPhone X Edition. A smartphone is all about the screen. You can tell when you hold this phone in your hand and look at the screen this is the best in the world. I doubt Apple is making as much profit on each of these due to it's high cost to manufacture such a brilliant device. They've already admitted that it's a very low price for what they are getting. This is the phone people will keep for years. Who needs the upgrade program... just buy it to keep. And at last Apple has a smartphone that can be in water up to 30 minutes and it won't be ruined. I'm still going to treat mine like gold, but it's nice to know it's not so fragile in rain or if I accidentally drop it in water briefly. Those days of worry are gone with the X edition. Love it! One more thing: long battery life and wireless charging!!!Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Good value.,"Thin profile, and good size screen. Lots of storage. Overall good phone for the money.",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Just do it,I have had the XR for 1 month now and I can say it's all positive. The battery life last all day long and sometimes I don't even charge for 2 days. (im not on it all the time and I keep my brightness at the lowest pretty much all day but still good battery life) All the functions on the phone work amazingly and even the condition of the phone they sent me was top notch. My favorite part is the storage! If you are going to get an apple phone please don't go with anything under 128gb bc they eat up the storage. The 256 is amazing Im not even close to filling it up and I have loads of apps and over 15000 pics and videos. The camera and all the features are ace as well. I upgraded to this from an iPhone 7 with 64gb that I HATED. So I would say if you're on the fence just do it! You won't regret the upgrade!Read full review...,5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,First month,"I've been using this iPhone 6 Plus for a month now. I am very happy with the results! I've had one issue though, out of the box it had ""touch disease"". You can just look it up, it's basically a hardware issue that apple has with their devices. It was a simple fix, I bought a repair kit for $6 and had to take apart my phone and basically place a piece of an old gift card on top of the touch sensors. There's a few YouTube videos out there on how to do it, but after that I haven't had the problem come back and I've been using it for about 3 weeksRead full review...",5

I never understood how it really works, you hit the volume rocker all the way down and when you open a video it switches to another volume control and you will still hear sound. I have no idea then what the volume rocker stands for.Android 9 has a very intelligent system, where sounds are classified into 4 types:Phone ring: Call ring, duh!Media: whatsapp, music, etcNotification: message, email, app notificationAlarms: alarm clock.Each have a separate volume control and you can know exactly what volume each has all the time. The volume rocker controls media volume, and you can tap to turn notification sounds on/off/vibrate. Those 2 are probably the ones you are interested most. Very smart.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,A good upgrade for IOS 13,"The iPhone 8 is more sensitive to the touch/handling than the iPhone 6 I had previously. Both the screen and the side buttons are very sensitive to touch. The processor is a lot faster than the iPhone 6, and I'm very pleased with that. The 8 is a little heavier than the 6 because of the glass case. Overall, I am pleased with the iPhone 8 (64 GB), and I think it can better handle the new IOS 13. I purchased the iPhone 8 because the16GB on the iPhone 6 was not enough memory to handle the IOS upgrade and even just minimal apps.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Battery not so great.  Your mileage may vary.,Not sure the battery is so great.I bought 3 so far.First one had been great and came in with 92% battery health.Second one came with 88% battery heath and crashed at 40% in cold weather due to bad battery.Got a 3rd to replace the 2nd.  It also came with 88% battery health but so far no issues.Read full review...,2
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Great Price & Features, for Photos get the XR though.","The iPhone 8 is exactly the same size as my old iPhone 6, I'm even using the same case for it.  The camera is in a slightly different position though.  The processor is super quick and I feel like the haptic feedback that my iPhone 6 didn't have makes a big difference in the hand-feel of the phone while using it.  It charges to 75% in just around 45mins and that charge lasts all day long with moderate usage.  I constantly text and Reddit and Discord on my phone and it handles all of that beautifully.Personally, I've noticed that Apple is cutting production on the iPhone X and it's no wonder why considering that the ten and the eight have the same processor but the 8 is nearly $200 cheaper than the XR.  Honestly for price and features, unless you really love taking photos, it's a slam dunk to choose the iPhone 8 over the iPhone XR.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,A Powerful Phone That Will Still Fit in Your Pocket,"It seems like cell phones just keep getting bigger....before too long at this rate cell phones will be as large as iPads! For me the iPhone 7 and 8 plus were just too large, so I preferred the size of the iPhone 8. This phone has a 4.7 inch screen, which is more than adequate, but it still fits in your pocket. It has a very powerful processor, much faster than the iPhone 7, which should make it very capable of running new updates for many years. I also has wireless charging which will be standard in most vehicles in the near future.I highly recommend this phone...it is powerful, stylish, and will be capable of running software updates for many years to come!Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,GIFT FOR DAUGHTER,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my daughter and it seems to be working perfectly. My research showed that the iphone 6s plus would accept all of the newer apps and might be more durable than the later models. It is not water resistant, but it has an earphone jack which the newer models do not. The flap about Apple slowing the phone seems to have been resolved with Apple offering a new battery for the 6s at a discount-yet another reson to get this phone. The price can't be beat. Amazon had a reconditioned phone for 1/3rd more.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Used iPhone 7 matte black ,"This particular iPhone 7 in matte black is really pretty in design just like I‚Äôve seen on YouTube. This phone does get a 7 out of 10 rating. This phone is almost like new, but the screen does contain some scratches and are more noticeable only when the sunlight hits it. Also has some minor signs of use on the back as well, but it‚Äôs not badly used or beat up. Overall, it‚Äôs only been a week and two days and I love using the iPhone 7. It‚Äôs a great quality phone after using the iPhone 5s. Read full review...",2
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Overall worth it, battery could be better, just dots one of the sides and a little on the back we‚Äôre the only signs of use.","Phone is in overall great condition. No scratches dots are marks in the screen. Noticeable amount of small white dots on the right side of the phone (which end up getting covered by my case) and a couple of white dots on the back of the phone that I just put a dot of black permanent marker on. Wouldn‚Äôt even knew they were there. Battery life could be better though seems the battery is slightly used out but still decent life, like I said still over all worth the purchase.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,So far so good! The black is really slick looking!,"Not small by any means. Much bigger compared to my 5s. The only reason I was ""forced"" to upgrade was because everything stopped updating and the camera was awful. I was caught off guard when I charged it to 100% and when I received my sim card in the mail a few days later, I turned the phone on and it was at 45%. Not sure if draining while it's off is normal or not. So far so good though, lots to learn and so far a great buy. I cannot wait to take pix and videos and see better quality seeing how I heard nothing but great things. The black finish is so slick looking as well. Thanks so much for a great buy and experience!Read full review...",4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Has everything I need for under $225!,Once it gets set-up it's great.  Wifi calling was my main purpose in upgrading.

Once I changed that everything worked great!  Love the font options and long battery life.Read full review...,5

Apple Laptops,Great laptop! You won't be disappointed!,"I wanted to buy a lightweight, yet powerful laptop for college and was considering buying a Windows 8 machine until I found this laptop on eBay. It is the absolute perfect weight and has that sophisticated style that any college student can appreciate. The i5 processor completes any task given to it with ease. I enjoy mostly everything about the laptop with the minor exceptions being the battery life and lack of a higher resolution display. At a rated 7 hours it is nothing to sneeze at, but watching videos and extensive use will shorten the overall time. I know the latest generation Intel chips have solved this problem and it is not a fault of the machine itself. The screen is bright and vivid, although recent full HD, 4K, even Apple's own Retina display best this unit's 1440 x 900 resolution. Compared to other laptops, this wins hands down! The PC's I considered had sturdy builds, but the reputation that Windows 8 has and Apple's ability to build great laptops sealed the deal. With the few minor gripes I have, emphasis on minor, this is a great overall laptop and one that I would recommend to anyone. Apple built a workhorse of a laptop and one that will be able to take whatever the average user will throw at it.Read full review...",5
Apple Laptops,Used but not abused,Second purchase from Tek. First was an iPad. Both items in great shape and work fine. Airbook hard to tell from new. Why pay twice or 3 times as much?!,5
Apple Laptops,Recommended. Lightwieght and fast.,I was a Macbook Pro user until I found this little gem. Machine is a refurbished unit but looks and performs like new with Mojave OS. Wasn't sure about the 4 GB Ram but it works extremely well and does everything asked of it. Lightweight design makes it a lot easier to take anywhere.Downside is the upgradeability isn't as quick and easy as the old Macbook Pro. Memory is soldered into the motherboard.Read full review...,5
Apple Laptops,"For the average user, this is the ultimate laptop for your money.","After being a loyal MacBook Pro fan, I have finally switched over to the MacBook Air.  The newest generation MacBook Air packs a powerful i5/i7 that easily outperforms my 2009 2.66Ghz Intel Dual Core Macbook Pro.  The battery life is amazing, I'm able to get very close to what Apple has quoted, and having a Solid State Drive, the battery can stay charged for literally weeks when in sleep mode, forget about turning this laptop off!  The boot times are phenomenal, and will surpass any Macbook with a traditional HDD.  I love how portable this laptop is, its extremely lightweight and much more bag friendly than my 15.4"" MacBook Pro.  This laptop is going to be more than perfect for you if you like to browse the web, watch videos, edit documents, or edit pictures.  Now, if your needing more power for gaming or memory intensive programs such as Adobe Illustrator, I would suggest looking into a MacBook.  But, for most users, I believe this laptop will more than fit the everyday users needs.  I'm confident that this laptop will stay modern and compatible with all Apple software for another 4 or 5 years, and I'm even more confident that this laptop will hold its value for several years, I believe that the Intel i5/i7 processors will be here for awhile, and over the next few years, solid state drives are going to grow even more popular.Read full review...",5
Apple Laptops,Very good item,"he 2012 MacBook Air no longer stands as the coolest Mac laptop: that crown has been temporarily stolen by the Retina Display MacBook Pro. Nor is it as unusual. However, it still remains the best example of an ultrathin laptop -- for its construction quality, performance, and ergonomics.The 13-inch Air has the same looks as last year, and nearly the same build, with a few key differences: a new third-gen Intel Core i5 processor, USB 3.0 ports (replacing the previous USB 2.0), a higher-def 720p Webcam, and an altered MagSafe 2 charge cable and connector. Also, both 13-inch MacBook Pro models now cost $100 less, bringing the entry-level model with 128GB solid-state drive (SSD) to $1,199, the exact same cost as the 13-inch MacBook Pro.Read full review...",5

Apple Laptops,Best super portable computer i ever had!,"I Got this computer and was amazed of how good the battery life is, for the things that i want is a perfect fit, if you want to do editing or need a lot of hard drive space (for HI DEF Movies and stuff) maybe this is not a very cost effective option but for mid range to casual user or a college student this is a great choice.One of the most portable computers out there and a great value, if you can get a 2011 or 2012 model with 128Gb for under 1,100 go for it. Some people complain about not being able to burn a CD since it doesn't have CD/DVD/R/W but theres a lot of options of external drives out there and this might be a factor to consider if you burn a lot of CD's all the time.I don't find myself doing it very often so is not an issue for meNo complains on performance yet.Read full review...",5
Apple Laptops,"Sleek, superlight, fast and responsive. Great for mid-level, everyday use.","Love how it boots up immediately. Everything about it is faster. Always wanted to try an SSD and willing to live with the smaller (120GB) storage for the faster response and bootup time. I keep the drive lean and use an external FW (w/Thunderbolt-to-FW adapter) when needed. I don't use a lot of CPU-intensive applications. Display is crisp and bright, tho not a retina. Haven't noticed any issues w/battery--seems to hold a decent charge when I've used it, tho haven't actually timed it. Ships with Mountain Lion, which I've already come to love.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Excellent quality, great value","The iPhone 8/8+ is the last model made by Apple that still has the physical Home/unlock button, which can be important to those concerned with privacy who dislike the Face ID (facial recognition) feature of newer phones (or to those concerned with the fact that - should the situation arise - one cannot be legally required to use a fingerprint or code to unlock their phone, but cannot prevent facial recognition from being used to do so).That issue aside, the iPhone 8/8+ that I purchased arrived in excellent condition (truly, I could not find so much as a smudge, let alone a scratch or ding) and functions perfectly.  The size is perfect, large screen but not too big to hold.  I'm very happy with this item.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,iPhone X Impression,"Overall a very good product, but significantly overpriced. There are only a few  things that I would like to see changed:1. Make it easier to close an app. The current method involves taking four steps. First, swipe up; then pause and wait for the minus sign to appear; then press it; then swipe the slider to close the app. Apple needs to find a better way.2. Make it easier to close the IPhone. Holding down buttons on both sides of the unit is so awkward that I actually go to settings to close the phone. 3. Have four direction keys on the keyboard. Scrolling would be much easier. 4. Include a sound mixer to adjust base, mid and treble.5. Make it possible to adjust the size of the icons. There may be more because I just started using it and am still learning.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Best phone i‚Äôve ever owned,"Where do i even start? this phone is just simply amazing to use, from the effortless unlocking with face id to the beautiful oled screen to the fast wireless charging and fast cable charging, not to mention that you can pick up a basically brand new one for around $850, i‚Äôll start with the battery, it is the best battery i have ever used in an iphone, it easily lasts 12 hours with moderate use and i‚Äôve even pushed it to 15 on low power mode, that combined with fast wireless charging means i don‚Äôt even have to think about charging it, just plunk it down on the wireless charger before bed wake up with a fully charged battery rinse and repeat. the screen is also the best i‚Äôve ever seen on an iphone, everything is super crisp and surprisingly colour accurate for an oled, compared to samsung‚Äôs super saturated screens it is great. also no burn in to speak of whatsoever. the speakers are the best on any iPhone i‚Äôve ever owned only being beat out by my iPad pro, they get super loud and pack a surprising amount of punch for their size. the cameras are also simply put amazing, i get perfect low light shots and vibrant daytime shots, along with portrait mode for the front and rear cameras and 4k 60 video you can‚Äôt go wrong. as for looks this is as good as it gets, this phone is simply beautiful, from the shiny glass back to the nearly bezel-less screen to the stainless steel around the body it is simplistically perfect, i get looks all the time walking down the street with this thing and some people have even stopped me to try it, side note this is the most solid iphone i‚Äôve ever owner as well, there is no creaks or bumps and it feels like i‚Äôm holding something super rigid and solid.  no phone is perfect but this is damn near close to perfection in the phone world Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,You Can't Go Wrong With This Phone. Face ID is Awesome!,"I can't imagine a phone being any better than this.  My favorite feature is the Face ID.  This makes logging into my bank accounts so easy.  No more passwords and user names to remember.  I'm hoping that ALL websites implement the option to let you log in using Face ID in the future.  The display is crisp and clean.  The phone feels good in your hand.  The camera takes beautiful, clear video and pictures.  The phone is changes between screens and pulls up apps more quickly than my laptop.  I like the size of this phone.  Since there is no border around the edges of the screen, the display seems much larger than other phones its size.  I thought I'd miss the ""Home Button"" at the bottom of the display, but almost immediately after using my iPhone X for the first time, I realized how much better swiping up was compared to needing to use the home buton.  The only critisisms I have: 1)  the battery life isn't great.  2)  there is no jack to plug in wired headphones.  I almost always use Bluetooth headphones phones but it's nice to know you've got the option of plugging in headphones with wires as well.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Looked good, did not work as well.",When I first got the phone it looked great. No cracks or scratch marks on the phone. I was able to turn it on and get it set up just fine. When I went to push it to vibrate so the sound wouldn't go off any more the vibrate did not work. The phone kept making sound even after all attempts were made to make the sound turn off. Even on the lowest setting and on sound off it would still ring and make sound. Also the volume on a call is super low. I could hardly hear anyone on the other end. Not a good value for what I paid for. I understand it was refurbished but not impressed.Read full review...,2

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great product,"I‚Äôm really liking this iPhone, I upgraded from a iPhone X to this model. ",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,A solid baseline,"Aside from lack of a 3.5mm head jack, it's about as good of an iPhone as you can get without jumping up to the Face ID generation. I appreciate a small phone, and while not tiny, I find the regular sized iPhone to be manageable.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,It's Okay,I switched from Android to try the iPhone 8 out. iOS 11 is showing some lack luster performances and glitches at the moment. Camera seems good. Sound is good and better than previous phones. Not easy to manage music and photos. In my opinion it's to expensive for what you getting.Read full review...,3
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Perfect phone for my needs,"I am not interested in the current trend of large format cell phones and this one is only slightly larger than the iPhone 4S I had. I particularly like the thumbprint feature (it actually works), the faster processing speed, and better notification settings. I've seen some comments about a short battery life but I have not noticed that. I do not, however, spend a lot of time reading articles, looking at Facebook, etc., so maybe that is why.Read full review...",4

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Works like new!,"Got the used iPhone 8 quick, and even though its used it looks brand new and works perfectly. Way cheaper than buying it new from Apple or even refurbished from Verizon.",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Fast, Beautiful (Space Gray), Affordable, Capable, Awesome!","This phone is nice to use and doesn't suffer from the ostentatious trends of the bleeding edge. I highly recommend it if you want to prolong your need for a new device for at least a few more years. At least that's what I bought it for and I'm glad I did. It's snappy, charges quickly, makes nice noises, and is super fast to unlock‚Äîsometimes unlocking so quickly I don't get to see the lock screen. Also, the smaller form factor of the non-plus-sized iPhone is much more desirable, especially when one recognizes the importance of different devices for different activities and chooses to use the iPhone as a phone and not a recreation device for movies and books. Use it as a phone and you'll be happy with it over its larger sibling. Oh and it is just a hair thicker than the previous generation which makes it really nice to hold in the hand. Stop making phones so freakin' thin, Apple!!! We don't need it, it is actually counterproductive to the way we use our phones.Read full review...",5

Car Stereos & Head Units,"Very good, but not perfect","Other than this product I've never used AA/CP before so I can only judge it on its own and against the built-in Mazda Connect system.For the most part it is fine, works well enough and is easy to use.BUT, as opposed to Mazda Connect it requires the phone be connected to the car via USB in order to use Apple CarPlay. I believe that is also the car with Android Auto but I haven't tried that myself.I can't fairly complain as I should have done proper research before ordering, and that probably wouldn't be a deal-breaker for me anyway, but I like that with Mazda Connect I can use the phone via Bluetooth and not need to have an ugly USB cable stretched across the cabin.One of the things I like very much about the product is the more powerful USB port. The newer port is actually capable of charging smartphones.Nothing else really to say. The product does what it is supposed to do and works fine. Med Center Mazda has the best price I found for it, and showed promptly. I have no real complaints.Read full review...",4
Car Stereos & Head Units,Product great - CarPlay not so much,"Get some instructions online how to remove parts and which ones needed.  Only tool you really need is a Phillips head as most pieces can be pulled off by hand.  No problems installing and works but CarPlay is really not much better than the Mazda System.  The screen for what is playing, Pandora, podcasts, etc it doesn‚Äôt  even show the album artwork when this can be done over Bluetooth without CarPlay.  Makes no sense.  Also I want to use Waze but of course when I press the Navi button it goes to AppleMaps no matter what.  Also can‚Äôt delete certain apps like maps.  Also it only works when plugged in to center console. Anyway the hardware is great.  I would really be ticked if I had paid a dealer $400+ for this.   Hopefully Apple will address some of these issuesRead full review...",4
Car Stereos & Head Units,Genuine Mazda parts for a fraction of what a dealer would charge,"The parts are genuine and factory-new, but you will need to search for installation instructions, as the instructions that come with the hardware appear intended for Mazda mechanics who already know how to string wiring in a car.  (To get user-friendly instructions, try googling for Mazda, Modfreakz and ASH8.)  Also, as other purchasers noted, you will need to make sure that the Mazda Connect system in your car already has firmware version 70 or higher.  Otherwise, you must upgrade the firmware, and you must do so before installing this hardware.If you are moderately handy and have studied the on-line instructions and videos, then you can do the hardware installation in under three hours.  (This does not include the firmware update, which is 60 to 90 minutes, once you download the requisite files.)  You should buy a cheap set of tools (maybe 10 bucks) to remove the trim around your dashboard so that you don't scratch anything.  You also will need a Phillips screwdriver, a set of clippers that can cut through plastic ties, and a socket wrench with a 10- to 15-inch extender along with a 10mm socket.CarPlay gives Mazda's Connect entertainment system a much-needed facelift.  CarPlay is definitely faster than Mazda Connect.  And a Mazda dealer would charge three or four times this price for the parts and installation.  The CarPlay system for Mazda requires a USB connection between the car and the phone, whereas some other automakers have implemented CarPlay with a bluetooth connection.  The USB requirement notwithstanding, Mazda has a good implementation of CarPlay, and it definitely is worth the price charged here.Read full review...",5
Car Stereos & Head Units,"Excellent Purchase, Save loads over the cost @ your dealer.","Parts as listed were exactly the kit needed for the install. Don't spend more than double the price at a dealer and have them install. The kit provided is all the parts you need. Only piece that isn't included that some have suggested you might need would be a Car Trim Removal tool. Personally a good Flat-Head Screwdriver wrapped in painters/masking tape would do the job just fine.The hardest/longest part of the whole process beyond wrapping the wiring pieces with foam tape is probably the actual threading of the wires/cables into the correct place. Everything is labeled and clearly stepped through in the guide included. If you need additional help Google searching for the install instructions worked for me.Don't forget to update the software on your car before installing the HUB/Harness assembly. Failure to do so first may cause issues and Mazda does not recommend that.imgur dot com slash a slash senQGSm For some guide like pictures of the parts removed. NOT ALL STEPS DOCUMENTED, NOT A COMPLETE GUIDE.Read full review...",5
Car Stereos & Head Units,Works Well but be careful.,Works Well. Function is seamless and similar to other carplay products I have used. There is a slight lag in response to an iphone when you first plug into the USB. If you bought this then you are likely attempting to do the upgrade on your own or with an independent installer. Read directions very carefully and follow the steps exactly. Protect your dash with cloth or sufficient tape when removing the infotainment screen from the dash to access the cables.

Car Stereos & Head Units,Save yourself money and do it yourself!,Im very satisfied with my purchase. Same OEM parts that your dealer installs but you save 2/3rds of the price diy instead of dealer install. At first I thought it would be tricky but it was actually simple. I had it installed and running in about an hour tops. Just be sure and upgrade firmware first. Great product!Read full review...,5
Car Stereos & Head Units,Great product,"Just as described, but a little disappointed it did not come with instructions.

Car Stereos & Head Units,Works as you would expect,"Installation was fairly easy, lots of videos online and tips/tricks on various forums.Since it is getting cold out, I made sure to warm up the car before removing trim pieces. During the install I used a space heater in the car (I don't have a garage that fits my car).I have not tried CarPlqy, but the Android auto works well. I am very glad they allowed this to work on older cars, I have a 2014 Mazda 3 hatchback.Read full review...",5
Car Stereos & Head Units,Retrofit kit works perfectly in my 2015 Mazda 3 GT,"The kit came with everything you needed, the USB port, cables, foam tape, zip ties. The instructions to install can be found online on the Mazda3revolution website. I also watched Greg Pettus' DIY installation videos on Youtube.Total time for me to do all was about 1.5hours. MAKE SURE you have updated your infotainment system to at least 70.00.xxxx firmware before installing this kit! I'm someone who has zero car experience but everything worked out in the end and now my Mazda has the official Android Auto! I'm very happy with the kit and Android Auto!Read full review...",5
Car Stereos & Head Units,Excellent kit but no instructions,"The kit arrived in great condition and is working perfectly.My only gripe is that is arrived with no installation instructions at all.It took me forever to track down all the relevant information for installation.

Car Stereos & Head Units,"Good value, standard Mazda parts. Make sure that you research the steps if doing your own install","Shipping was well packed and average time for US to Canada. The cables and hub appear to be genuine Mazda parts and fit according to specifications. The foam tape and tie-wraps provided were more than adequate.Installation instructions for the firmware (Mazda software update) were not obvious in the documentation, nor were the installation instruction details, but since these were intended as Mazda dealer install items, that is to be expected. A bit of Googling leads to a number of Mazda online groups which provide the information.The most important caution (that the firmware must be updated before installing the cables and hub) were repeated several times so no one should have missed this important step.Installation for an experienced automotive technician was about 1/2 hour, for the cables & hub, given that the hub was located in the console rear, under the lid.If someone has installed the TWEAKS and wishes to be able to reload these, some research is required as upgrading the firmware to version 70 closes off the USB install option.Read full review...",5

Car Stereos & Head Units,Takes some getting used to. But works great,"Works great. Works as it's supposed to. I use it for Android auto and if you are new to Android auto it dose take some getting used too .. what I really like and cam to a surprise is that the Mazda Home, audio, and navigation buttons work with Android auto. Meaning when I push the audio button it will take me to the Android auto audio app. When I push the Navi button it will take me to the Android auto navigation app. And not the Mazda Navi. I also like that the stock radio can play while in Android auto I have not seen that in other car manufacturer. Read full review...",5
Car Stereos & Head Units,"Correct hardware, tricky removal of old parts, but easy installation otherwise.","Used this kit to upgrade the USB hub and cables for carplay compatibility in my 2016.5 CX-5. Getting the old hub out was the most challenging part of the installation, otherwise it was fairly straightforward. Double check what tools you will need in order to remove the head unit properly - I lacked an extension for one of the bolt removals that slowed down my installation. Took me about two hours to complete, including firmware installation.Read full review...",5
Car Stereos & Head Units,Works great good product.,Finally have a modern app to use on my Mazda.  Works same as any other radio with car play.  Install is a bit challenging I had to remove most of the center console shifter Surround to get the old harness out.  There are several YouTube videos that helped with this.  So be prepared for some work there.  The firmware update went perfectly again I watched a few YouTube videos and read some forums to learn how.  This must be done first and correctly or you will have problems.  The whole process took me several hours to complete.  If you are not mechanically inclined or computer savvy you might want to take it to a dealership.Read full review...,5
Car Stereos & Head Units,Mazda upgrade!  Well worth it if you don't have it!,"Excellent, easy update to perform on your Mazda to get a much more integrated mobile phone experience in your vehicle.

Car Stereos & Head Units,Flawless,"Installed flawlessly on our 2016 CX-5. Great price and super fast shipping. Will be ordering another for our 2017 Mazda6Tip for those installing on a car with the HUB located at the bottom of the center stack: instead of removing the whole center console and sliding it back, take a drill with a small but long drill bit and drill a hole through each corner where the clips hold the HUB unit in place. This will break the clips and allow you slide the the unit out thereby saving you an hour of work and frustration. You could also use a long, thing screwdriver to break the clips from the back of the dash too.Read full review...",5

Car Stereos & Head Units,Exactly what I wanted for my 2015 Mazda3,"I was a little nervous to do the install myself because I didn't want to break anything, but the tutorials I watched on YouTube kept me sane and made it not too terrible. All told, it took me approximately 2 hours to install. Everything worked perfectly on the first try. I had updated the software a few days prior, so I knew that was working correctly. Overall this is exactly what I wanted. Am I annoyed that when I bought the car it was only supposed to be a software update away? Sure, but instead of spending $500 for the dealer to do it, I did it myself for $150 + 2 hours of my own time. Time I probably would have spent at the dealer anyway.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Very happy with iPhone 6S,"The 6S works perfectly for my needs.  I love the ID-touch; sure beats typing in my pin every time I use it like I used to do.  The IOS app provided a very easy transition from my old android phone.  It transferred everything I needed - contacts, photos, calendar info, etc.  There is plenty of storage space, it gets good reception, it's easy to use and navigate.  It's an excellent phone.  I do miss the ability to categorize my contacts though.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Good Solid iPhone.,"This iPhone 8 is awesome. It fits my hand perfectly, works fast and connects with all my other apple devices seamlessly. It doesn't have all the features of the iPhone X, like face unlocking , but that's no big deal it steal has a fingerprint reader. It's form factor is the same as iPhone 7 and a lot of cases and whatnot that fit the 7 will fit the 8 just as well. It has a glass front and back, so it's very slippery and is a fingerprint magnet. For me a case is a must ! With 256gb of memory you can load it up and not have to worry about running out of storage. Battery life hasn't been too bad. I can get a whole day easily,but i'm a moderate user and don't play games on my phone, an iPhone 8 Plus would be better for that anyway. All that being said, This is a good solid iPhone. One of Apples best!Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,This iPhone 8 is buggy!,"Honestly I liked my old iPhone 7 better; I bought this iPhone 8 so I could give the iPhone 7 to my daughter as a birthday present.But this new phone has had a number of problems:1) cellular didn't work at all at first: people were calling and texting me while I was out shopping with kids, but I got none of those calls/texts.  It wasn't until I got back home on Wifi that I got the notifications.  Later I restarted the phone and got the cellular working, and it has worked fine since.  So perhaps an initial/new-phone/one-time setup carrier settings thing?  But still is a very annoying problem.2) ""Hey Siri"" does NOT work at all.  I've got the latest iOS 12.4.1 installed.  Of course I've tried to troubleshoot this, googled for answers, etc. all to no avail.  Doesn't work.  But microphone works just fine.  Looks like an iOS software bug.  Very annoying.3) For the past few days, the phone display wouldn't rotate, i.e. no Landscape mode!  It was locked in Portrait rotation, and yes I verified the rotation lock wasn't engaged.  And of course I turned the rotation lock on and then back off again, all to no avail.  Had to do an iPhone restart to get rotation working again.  Apple, WTH?4) Touchscreen performance is not as good as on the iPhone 7.  Particularly near the top and bottom of the screen; it's just not as accurate/sensitive.  I often have to press 3 or 4 times in my WhatsApp text input window just to activate it to be able to text somethingIn short, this is a buggy phone.  How the heck did Apple make a new phone that's worse than the old one?  Makes me leery about ever getting an iPhone X!Anyway I guess I'll get by with this phone...Nice to have 256GB of storageRead full review...",3
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Best iPhone EVER,"I own a iPhone 11 Pro right now and it‚Äôs ok but I tell u my iPhone 8 was my favorite of ALL. I‚Äôm about to sell my 11Pro and go back to the 8. I loved my iPhone 8 and it‚Äôs not as huge as the newer iPhones. The ppl who give this phone a bad review because of connection are idiots, your connection problems are due to your choice of network providers , NOT the iPhone itself . Since I switched to Verizon I haven‚Äôt had problems with connections and blind spots. It‚Äôs not the iPhone. The iPhone 8 is an incredible awesome piece of technology. I had more problems with my iPhone 11Pro. If it doesn‚Äôt see your face, u can‚Äôt get in your phone. But with fingerprint, u always get in. If I could I would stay with my iPhone 8 forever. It‚Äôs my favorite out of all the cellphones on the market and I‚Äôve tried them ALLRead full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Speaker broken,"Phone was MOSTLY in condition as described- EXCEPT that actual phone calls are almost impossible w/o use of headphones because the phone speaker is messed up.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Prefer a smaller phone?,I love the size of this phone - most newer phones are too big to keep in my front shirt pocket.,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,An overall positive experience!,"Flawless in appearance, rated good seems excellent to me.I bought it to replace my Samsung Galaxy S7 which while versatile fought me every inch of the way.SIM card transferred over easily and I immediately saw the better operation of the iPhone.I was surprised to see how after I had left the charger for a half hour I still had power in the high eighties. With the Androids I carried two spare batteries to get me through a day.The fingerprint unlock gave instant feedback yea or nay (usually yea), where I was used to no response from S7 until I got five nays when it would tell me it was locking me out for 30 seconds or enter the PIN.The reason I made the switch was because of IOS's direct interface to hearing aids, but I got so very much more benefit!Plus the product came faster than expected!Read full review...",5

Apple Laptops,"Solid, light, and elegant","The Macbook is a superb laptop as long as your priority is small and light. It's monitor is especially good. It also comes with 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of solid state hard drive. While it's certainly not the fastest processor available, it's the quietest and able to do most jobs other than intense video processing or gaming, but then if you had those apps, you wouldn't be likely to get one in the first place.The bottom line is there's very little out there than can match the Macbook in its area of expertise, especially if you also have other Apple products and want to coordinate amongst them.Read full review...",5

Smart Watches,does what it claims,"if I have a call come in while I am already talking with someone, the first call becomes disconnected automatically and the second caller is available without telling the watch to do so. I understand that when I am talking with others the call does sound like it is coming from a speaker instead of an actual phone.  Not sure if this is because I received a refurb instead of the new one I ordered though.Read full review...",3

Cell Phones & Smartphones,By phone an avoid up charge from Verizon,"With Verizon they have a new sneaky way when you upgrade to I phone 8.  Quote $249 with payments of $20 month and 2-year contract.  Not bad huh, so $20 x 24 = $720, almost the full price of $779 with tax for new outright.But - and here is the biggie.  The extra $20  will continue as an "" access charge"" forever.So you have now $240 a year more as long as you have Verizon. Best bet is to buy a phone like this which continues to be the same monthly charge on your account.Gary ShowalterRead full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Defective phone that took waaaaaaay  too long to get to me,"Shipping was right on the mark. An eternity.  Two week shipping in today‚Äôs market is ridiculous. Place that on top of a defective phone that will need to go back to Apple, far from impressed.  Phone has a defective speaker and most of the sound is muffled. Also has a loud random beep in the ear.    I peeled the shrink wrapping from the box, or I would accuse them of selling me a defective piece of garbage.Read full review...",1

Cell Phones & Smartphones,great phone w/o issues.,phone is brand new and I have no issues.  The only complains is the shipping is slow.,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,These guys always deliver what is advertised. it's a low risk purchase,"this is a 4.9star review: this is my second used phone from these guys and they always deliver solid quality. cosmetically, the screen and body were in near new condition. you had to look very hard to find ultra fine scratches on the body (invisible under a clear case) and the screen was perfect. when you checked the battery, it was at 91% of useable life (thus the 4.9*)...to be expected with a used product. In my experience with iphones, when these internal Lithium batteries reach below 60%, they don't hold a charge and will not last a full day. Everything in the phone worked as you would expect from an iphone 2 years old but working on several updates.  Most apps are quick and there isn't any noticeable lag. Screen brightness is comparable to my other iphone8.  If I get 2 years use out of this, it was a worthwhile purchase.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,not a good deal,"From the very first time I turned the phone on, the haptic feedback didn't work correctly, it kept going off.  I tried to fix this issue in setting, I couldn't figure it out even when I turned off vibration totally.  Then the second day the phone screen went black and in order for me to see the screen I had to do a hard shutdown.  This shouldn't happen on a new phone.  I returned the phone.Read full review...",1

Smart Watches,Unable to Pair to iPhone 8 or update software on apple watch...,"Recently just picked up this apple watch series 4 and was so excited to use it. Unfortunately, what seemed like something too good to be true, may have been the case here. I unpaired my previous apple watch, and the necessary steps when pairing a new apple watch, but to my surprise my apple watch was not updating or pairing to my iPhone 8. I looked up various solutions to the same problems others have had and tried those solutions. I ended up having to go to Apple Support where we deduced the problem to be within the Apple Watch Series 4. I've requested a return offer now, let's see what comes up, I'm wanting another Apple Watch that works, not the same one. Will update with the conclusion.Read full review...",1

Excellent overall design.The PROS:Great build quality, superb screen, and expensive feel. Blazing fast performance, and more than enough bells and whistles.The CONS:Battery life is not improved over Series 3. For those who like sleep tracking, this watch is not the pick for you. Very expensive. Some might see Series 3 as a better value.Purchased mine directly from apple.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,As usual...apple users will love it,"It is a brand new iphone 8. I loved the red color. Everything was well packed. Boxed contained phone, earpods, lightning connector, and a charger.Only drawback I found in iphone is its battery. It takes longer time to charge and lasts only few hours if usage is high. This is drawback because there is too much improvement in this area in other cheaper brands as compare to apple  like oppo, vivo, micromaxI had micromax phone before iphone and it had super fast charging and its battery used to last at least twice more than iphone with similar usage.Read full review...",5

Apple Laptops,Huge surprise,"I had no idea of how terrific this Macbook Pro really was. I had notice an explosive proliferation in this computer, so I suspected there really was something special about it, I had a MacPro for many years for editing movies and pictures. I grew to love the Apple ecosystem, and the fact that once you learn how to maneuver in the system, It is the way computing should have been all along. I had been a pc advocate, using different brands like Dell and H-P. When the Windows 10 OS came out it was the last straw. PC laptops I had been buying were so cheaply and shoddily designed that they were finally obsolescent. The Macbook Pro is ruggedly built, incredibly well designed, including the retina display that blows me away every day. It comes with the best OS on the planet. The battery is long lived and it recharges quickly. One major advantage is that this machine is usable as soon as you turn it on and login. Not like a pc that is rendered unusable at login or at some arbitrary point you choose to receive updates.The major items that made this a great buy for me are the following:Value from the Apple ecosystem.Value from the great design and rugged construction.Value from high quality audio system for streaming video, and enjoying music.Value from the brilliant retina display.Value from the lighted keyboard.Value from the well cared for computer by the original owner.Best value of all was the third party software already installed by the previous owner. The Microsoft Office for Mac 2011, and CS6 Photoshop, Aperture.Read full review...",5
Apple Laptops,"Beautiful MacBook Pro, responsive, sleek, and light. Everything you want in a MacBook and more.","This MacBook Pro is an absolutely beautiful machine. I had issues with my 2011 Mac and so I decided to upgrade to this one, three years newer. For being only three years newer, it's night and day different than the 2011. For starters, it's way lighter and sleeker. I really love the feel and look of this model, 2014. It is very responsive and the screen, it's a beauty.I wish I had bought one with a bigger hard drive but, for the price I paid for this one, I'll live with the smaller hard drive. If you're on the fence about the 2014 MacBook Pro, rest assured that it's all that the descriptions says, and so much more. I will not be uploading pics because I just got it and really don't feel like taking photos of it right now but, believe me, it's really nice.Read full review...",5
Apple Laptops,Late 2013 Macbook Pro ‚Äú15‚Äù,The macbook came clean and very few to unnoticeable minor scratches just on the bottom of the macbook. Theres only one problem.

Apple Laptops,Excellent product and super easy setup!,"This is the entry level 15.4 size Mac Pro. For developers this is better than the 13.3 inc with dual core. If you plan to do lots of video editing, then you may need to up size the RAM to 16 vs 8. Also if you need more storage and RAM go with ME294 vs ME293. But for a developer this is the best value.Read full review...",5
Apple Laptops,Very good Mac.,"If you‚Äôre just getting into the world of apple and you want a laptop- skip the MacBook Air.

Overall, this is a very good Mac. 10/10 recommended.Read full review...",5
Apple Laptops,Last best MacBook,"Until Thunderbolt ports are doubled up on EVERYthing, I think this is the last great Mac laptop... it's still has it's Firewire ports AND a Thunderbolt port AND 2 USBs, and separate sound in and out, AND a built-in CD/DVD reader/writer.

Apple Laptops,Very Good but pricey and hard to justify whne an older machine can be just as fast for a few hundred dollars.,"This Mac Book Pro is very nice and does everything it is suppose to do. However, changing your HDD for a one TB. SSD, adding 16 gb of RAM, and my little 13"" 2012, Mac Book pro, did not have the touch bar and the fanciness of this unit, but was just about as fast. So we have a difficult to justify price for such 16 laptop. If you want a very good machine and money is no problem, by all mean, go for it. I did, I am just not sure it was the right decision?Read full review...",4
Apple Laptops,Great Laptop HORRIBLE COMPANY TO DEAL WITH,Seems like a great PC except this store I purchased it from won't send me a wall charger to charge the battery.I've contacted them 3 times and they sent me another cord but still nothing that plugs into the wall to charge the laptop.I've had this laptop for almost 3 weeks now and the battery is dead & I have no way to charge it.This is my first Apple product.

Apple Laptops,Best Laptop for the Older Customer,"I love my new MacBook Pro 16"". Computer is plenty fast, but I love the beautiful display and great sound system.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,A great phone!!,I have had a lot of iPhones and this one is my favorite. It‚Äôs right next to my iPhone 6 Plus. Both are great phones. The battery life is amazing. My last phone was a 7 and it was horrible. The battery would not last. I would work all day and go home and it would be at 50% or less. This phone is at 80% or more after working all day. Awesome phone. All the features are awesome. I highly recommend.Read full review...,5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,I like using the iphone XR.,I jumped from a very low battery life 6 s plus to the iphone  XR.     It has exceeded my expectations in charging ( only overnight- not 4-5 times a day). It takes great pictures and is user friendly.  Worth the price!Read full review...,5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great phone. Not too big.,The XR is a great phone. The larger screen makes everything easier to see. I went from a 5s to the XR.

I went to a vertical holster for the XR and it is perfect.Read full review...,5

Apple Laptops,At $1599 - unbeatable!,"With the new MacBooks expected some time this fall, this appeared to be a temporary price drop for this machine. I am guessing that, eventually, this price will return for those with patience.The MBP saw its last smaller upgrade a few months ago, but the design itself a few years old by now.  Nonetheless, this MBP does have  a major plus for me over the new versions, purportedly arriving with 4 USB-C ports only:  adapter-free compatibility with everything I need - HDMI, USB 3 and SDXC.  This is important to anyone who has to work with colleagues still using thumb drives, CDs, SD cards and date projectors without Apple TV.Initially, I was slightly concerned about the legitimacy of the product, but it came NIB, all original parts, wrappings with seals intact and the ability to purchase full 3-year AppleCare.Read full review...",5
Apple Laptops,Aesthetically Innovative and Structurally Defined,"Apple's 15.4"" MacBook Pro w/Retina Display & ForceTouch Trackpad is a truly redefining piece of unprecedented technology designed and assembled to increase the range, demand, and atmosphere of consumer productivity across all platforms. By transforming the machine itself, Apple presents a durable and promising tool that suits mediums established on professional, personal, and educational levels for an experience harnessed by the computer's multifunctional abilities. Not only does the MacBook Pro exceed traditional options in performance, but also with its stunning power to become singular in the routines of the user. Altogether, Apple's MacBook Pro w/Retina Display sets a new standard in its field, made specifically for every aspect of imagination.Read full review...",5
Apple Laptops,Favorite Laptop Ever,"This computer is absolutely wonderful.  The 2015 MacBook Pros are the best laptops I've seen, including Apple's more recent models.  Super light; sleek; huge, beautiful display; fast; silent; reliable; good autosaving if you let the battery run out; great keyboard and trackpad; nice speakers; still has the ports that are most important to me; doesn't get particularly warm, even with extended use; good OS options. My only complaints so far aren't about the computer itself. 1) The charger it came with burned out within a month and might have been a fake. I solved this with an old charger and the $10 Magsafe 1 to 2 adapter from Apple. 2) Pages is currently a terrible program compared to Word or Apache. But those are just tangential issues, not the computer itself. I love this laptop and will recommend it as the best all around laptop till Apple fixes the butterfly keys and other issues with the new Macs, or another company surpasses it.Read full review...",5
Apple Laptops,"Wonderful seller, Excellent product!","Well, I did not expect it would be as it was shown in the pictures! But this seller just surprised me! I was thrilled when the computer arrived in just 3 days of time and it was in excellent condition. The computer works perfectly! tested the product thoroughly before even installing my old computer's backup into this machine. Drained the battery out and filled back to see how it is! But again, that surprised me too! I meant to say that the battery is in excellent condition. The MacBook Pro Retina display 15inch Mid2015 is $1895 on Amazon and expensive in others that I looked and finally ended up giving it a try on eBay. But this seller has just sold me $1249. Plus, I've got Keyboard cover, snap cover for the machine, also MS Office 2016. And the fact I like about this seller is that he's instantly responsive to your text or message :) I was answered all the questions instantly or no later than an hour. Highly recommended! You don't get such a seller in these day and age on eBay. Note: Don't worry about the scam!! This seller is totally genuine!Read full review...",5
Apple Laptops,Mid 2015 rMBP,"In a time where the cost is more for less this hardware stands out as a good buy.Has all the speed, storage, and memory that most users would ever need. The display is still very crisp and meets or beats a lot of other machines on the market. It has all the ports that I still use and are more than efficient or sufficiently available for media needs without carrying multiple adapters. Light weight enough for everyday carry. (Not many people I know hike 10 miles on foot into work).So yes, a great value in an overpriced economy for machines that barely if at all best the 2015 rMBP.Read full review...",5
Apple Laptops,The Ferrari of laptops,"At $1,599 could not have received a better value than the 15"" MacBook Pro. There are zero complaints. Move my wife from the Windoze platform that I just ""worked on everyday to keep running"" to a platform that you can really use and get things done, especially with this awesome laptop. Mac is just a pleasure to use. Screen is outstanding, Memory at 16 gb is awesome and the HD is lightning. Bought it before the new one got too small and couldn't use all the great accessories I already have with my 13"" MacBook Pro. If you find it on sale, pull the trigger.Read full review...",5
Apple Laptops,Best time to buy one,"With the the release of the 2016 Macbook's closing in, it's a good time to buy last year's models because they're dropping in price.

I'm overall really pleased with this device. I recommend this to any developer or average consumer, it's a very nice machine. Read full review...",5
Apple Laptops,Huge improvement over late 2011 MBP,"I bought this to replace my aging 2011 Macbook Pro. Just about everything has been improved - it's lighter, sleeker, has USB 3 ports, has a Retina display, better colors, better sound, MUCH faster PCI based storage. Definitely a huge improvement if you have an older Macbook Pro, and the last model before Apple replaced all the ports with lightning ports, removed the MagSafe adapter, and removed the SD card reader. If you're upgrading from an older model, THIS is definitely the model to get at this time.Read full review...",5

Perfect for my job as a marketer.Read full review...",5
Apple Laptops,The Gold Standard,"This is simply the best notebook there is. I'm a long time ThinkPad fan, had several models, but when Apple debuted the first Unibody MacBook Pro, I had to make the switch. Since then, Apple has been on the crown.Apple does not make these without SSDs - so every single MacBook is FAST. Always easily outperforms 95% of all Windows Laptops simply because of the usage of a SSD. People think they need a faster CPU to browse the web - none sense. Most people don't use fast CPUs. This Laptop has performance where it matters the most.The weight and battery life are outstanding and industry leading. They are very thin. They are seamless, no competitor is able to produce a clean chassis like this one. The brand is instantly recognized every on the planet.Let's face the truth, if you sit down with a Dell or HP in a Starbucks, you look like you're a worker bee, putting in extra hours on the weekend. These devices have no sex in them. The MacBook Pro is the laptop that everybody desires. You know it.Read full review...",5
Apple Laptops,Pricey but excellent laptop,Its a mid to high end laptop from the apple lineup and not everyone may want to pay the premium for it.Very fast and responsive.

It comes in very good condition, mine only had the most minor scuffs on the bottom and a tiny dent that is only visible under perfect lighting. It even handles video editing and video games nicely.

Apple Laptops,Amazing quality!,"This was one of the biggest purchases I have ever made, so I was very hesitant. I've been needing a good laptop for college coming up as well as needing it to edit my photos. I wanted to get a good quality one with good storage and a larger screen. For everything I wanted, new it would've been around $2,000+. This is a pretty decent price for all that it is I would say. The shipping was so fast! It came in three days - a week early. And the quality is pretty dang good. Barely any scuffs noticeable. I love it!Read full review...",5

Apple Laptops,Still a great computer,"Despite being a few years old, this computer still has plenty of power and battery for the vast majority of people. It works perfectly for my needs.",5
Apple Laptops,Great for what it does,"Although it may not give the best bang for the buck value as compared to windows laptops in terms of immediate components, Apple has created a device that is optimized to do what it is meant to do, and what it does do, it does better than anything that windows can offer. It may be pricy, but in my mind, I find that it is worth it if you know what you want and what you'll be getting from an Apple computer.Read full review...",5
Apple Laptops,More pleased in knowing exactly the features you want.,This year model is the one I chose because it still had the features that complement my other Mac connections.

Apple Laptops,"MacBook Pro 15"" Mid 2015",For any price under $1600 it is a steal! The performance is great and the quality is top notch. With the new Mac Books set to be release in late October grabbing a heavily discounted older model is a great alternative! If your lucky enough to still be eligible for Apple care protection I would also invest in that too. Extending your warranty for three more years for support in case of any issues.  *Side note* The new Mac books may not even have the standard USB ports and HDMI port. Rumor has it they are set to be released with USB C which could add extras fees for people who need to purchase adapters and such.Read full review...,5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great Appearance -- Not at full functionality,"The Appearance of the product is great!  It was described to be in 8/10 condition, but it's probably more like 9/10.  The only cosmetic issue is a slight scratch on the screen thats only noticable from certain angles.  Functionality wise, the phone is not what I had hoped.  In settings it says that the battery is at 78% of the capacity it had when it was new -- Yikes!  Also the phone takes a verrrry long time to charge 2 and a half to 3 hours for a full charge...

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Great Phone, But Repetitive Design","The iPhone 11 Pro Max continues to showcase Apple's relentlessness at delivering quality products, but not without a cost. The price for the new iPhone is the same as its predecessor, iPhone Xs Max. It is generally viewed as a replica of the preceding model except for the new 3 lens camera in addition to a new midnight green color variation.

Headsets,it won‚Äôt fit in my ears,"I got these refurbished airpods at a GREAT deal. I had the original airpods brand new but one night when they were charging the power went out and it messed up the airpods where they won‚Äôt charge and won‚Äôt even show the pop up. It even deleted off of my iCloud. But I got these and they‚Äôre pretty great. I haven‚Äôt charged them in a day and it‚Äôs at 48% right now. They connect to my phone instantly so I don‚Äôt need to wait for the ping. So far the only problem I have is..they won‚Äôt fit in my ears. My entire family has airpods and my sister and I (before our original airpods broke) never had problems with them fitting in our ear. I went out and got a case at the store and it came with a bunch of stuff. A case, clip, a ‚Äúleash‚Äù to attach to your airpods so if one falls out it hangs on to the other, and two ear grip things (they wrap around your ear). Other than that I would like to use the airpods by themselves but without the ear grip on there the audio seems distorted and one would be louder than the other. Thank you!Read full review...",4
Headsets,Ok but should‚Äôve bought new,"They were in good condition and worked well at first, but started acting up after a week. Little things, like staying paired even after putting them back in the case, charging and battery life unpredictable, case only charging to 60%. I tried resetting them several times, but the glitches persist. I don‚Äôt expect perfection, as they were refurbished and therefore cheaper, but not enough cheaper in this case. I have experience buying refurbished Apple products, and this was the first let down.  I should have bought the new ones directly from Apple in this case, but that‚Äôs one me. Won‚Äôt buy refurbished AirPods again. Lesson learned.Read full review...",3
Headsets,Like New!! GENERATION 2 but not wireless charging case & no box ,I gave it a 4 stars because I expected them to come in a box and they didn‚Äôt come in a box. I know the wireless charging case works so that‚Äôs good but I don‚Äôt know how good the quality is of the sound because I haven‚Äôt used them because they‚Äôre Christmas presents for my daughter. Other than that they look brand new which is good because they‚Äôre not in a box.UPDATE: my girls used their AirPods and they worked like they were brand new! The sound was great I could hear their music when the AirPods were in their ears as well as the battery life was amazing!! They didn‚Äôt have to charge their case for TWO whole days even after using their AirPods all day. I see some people saying these aren‚Äôt generation 2. These are definitely GENERATION 2 the light is inside because the case is not a WIRELESS charging case. Generation 2 has two kinds of AirPods a charging case that has to charged with the power cord ( the light is inside the case) and the charging case that can be charged with a wireless charger (the light is outside the case). I mistakenly thought it was a wireless case as well but it‚Äôs not that type of AirPods. So if you‚Äôre looking for that type these are not it however these ARE generation 2 with a charging case. And they work like they‚Äôre new they just don‚Äôt come inside a box. As well as one of my charging cords didn‚Äôt come brand new. Other than that they were great especially for $99!!! That‚Äôs a deal!Read full review...,4
Headsets,Good not Great ,It‚Äôs easy to use yes but form now and then it keeps giving me static noise or the sound not that great but so far it‚Äôs quite alright I guess that‚Äôs what you pay for the price I‚Äôm a little disappointed but yeah .Read full review...,4
Headsets,"the product is good, but it‚Äôs probably only worth $80.","they sound great, especially with both in because of the virtual surround sound. very convenient to not have cords, and they‚Äôre also compact. obviously easy to use, so always be wary if you have the ‚Äúdropsies‚Äù like me. you will almost always have to overpay for apple products, but they do know how to make their products well.Read full review...",4
Headsets,Not that great. Disappointed with the sound ,Not that great... i thought sound would be better. I have similar earbuds that costed $30 and sound way better and have better features. over rated  for the quality and sound . ,4
Headsets,Lightweight with great features ,Its cool its nice its convenient i needed it for work im always on the go I love it because i use it all day and it rarely dies I didnt think i needed it til i got it haven't stop using it since.  ,5
Headsets,Amazing like new!!,I got these because they were $20 than brand new AirPods and I‚Äôm never one to complain about used items. They were grade A refurbished and mine came in the box with original style packaging and work like new. At first I thought they were new with all the sealing and packaging but could tell they were used once I connected them and they were named by the previous user. Great purchase and would recommended anyone looking to get AirPods and avoid the retail price to come here!Read full review...,5

Headsets,Great Value for a Quality Product,Very good earphones. Excellent price for the quality. One cannot tell it was a refurbished product. kudos to VIPOutlet for the work done on it.Highly recommended,4
Headsets,Great Earbuds but look out for compatibility!,"They just came in about 5 or so hours ago and I absolutely love them, very comfortable, light, look good and sound just as good or better than my expensive headphones. I was wanting to get away from using headphones all the time with my mac but found out that since I‚Äôm running macOS Sierra 10.12.6 it‚Äôs not compatible. Though it works fine with everything else I have that runs iOS 12.2 or later.Read full review...",4
Headsets,Best headphones you can buy,"The Apple AirPods are a great choice for wireless headphones. Not only do they work well with all other Apple products but they can still be used on other companies like Android and Samsung that have Bluetooth capability. When connecting to Apple products you just simply open them and wait for the connect option on your phone or tablet, a very seamless process. The battery life for the AirPods are great. One full charge of the case and the headphones normal last about a week to a week and a half of regular use. The headphones can also charge in fifteen minutes so they are very good for travel. These headphones are by far the most convenient and sleek headphones I have ever owned. The headphones sound quality is decent and they have a large volume range from barely audible to destroying your ears.Like other products the AirPods are not void of their own issues. While the headphones are great they only come in white so when around multiple people who have the AirPods there is no hope for determining which pair is yours. The case also tends to collect gross looking dust and earwax around the small rims and ledges around the face of the case which is hard to clean and very visible due to the white color they are produced in. Apple should probably make a cleaning solution for the case to resolve this issue. Overall the Apple AirPods are my favorite headphones I have ever owned. I find it very easy to look past their small issues due to the sheer amount of great uses they have to offer. I would recommend these headphones to anyone looking for a great pair of wireless headphones.Read full review...",5
Headsets,Worth the Cost,"The AirPods 2nd Gen have a lot of features like pausing when you take out your ear, double tapping to activate Siri, allowing you to customise what AirPod (left/right) activates what feature. They‚Äôre small but stay in the ear easily. The battery lasts for a long time and the case doesn‚Äôt require frequent charging. I debated on getting a pair for a while due to the cost and purchased two pairs of knock offs but the real AirPods are worth the cost.Read full review...",5

Headsets,My Review.,"I really like the airpods, I just don't like how it's always charging in the case; I think it would be bad for the battery in the long term if you are always charging it and not just storing them; charging when you don't need to seems bad.

Headsets,Live and Learn,"I refused to spend a grip of money for Apple products, so when i saw these at a great value, I jumped at the deal. Initially, I had an issue with a noise that repeated every 3 seconds. After learning how to properly sync my airpods to my phone, the noise went away. The airpod stay in my ear way better than my JBL ear buds did. I love that my phone gives me a charge level by percent as soon as I open the case instead of waiting to be surprised in the middle of a workout by my ear buds dying! I also love that I can use one at a time. They are comfortable in my ear for long periods of time. I use them while on conference calls and love that they work so well. I should have bought these AirPods years ago and saved the money I spent on the others. Read full review...",5

No way to tell if case or headphones are fully charged. Sound is subpar. Should have saved my money and bought a cheaper pair like my others. Read full review...",1
Headsets,May need to replace the right side,The right one has something going on with it. So you will need to buy a right one for them to correspond and show up on your iPhone to connect.

So Apple as well highly recommended for me to send them backRead full review...,1
Headsets,"Amazing, but the CASE isn't 2nd generation","Airpods are obviously really convenient and amazing, and I decided to buy these because I had lost my old ones a few days prior to when I bought this. Took one whole week to come, and it feels so amazing to be back with airpods. The airpods itself are definitely 2nd generation (says model A2032, A2031), but the case isn't, be mindful of that. It isn't a wireless charging case like the title and info suggests, and you can tell that because on the box and case itself, it says model A1602, which is just a normal charging case, and there is no LED indicator on the front of the case. However, if wireless charging doesn't bother you, you should pick these up since they are really good for its price and well worth it.Read full review...",5

Headsets,It was all a dream until,I opened the box and the first thing I was worried about was if they were genuine and they were which was a relief then I charged the case w/ the airpods inside. I open the case and it had a green light so that means everything is at 100% great. I take the case and Airpods off the charger cord and immediately the light turns off I'm like wtf why isn't it on I repeat the same process and then I even reset the case and try to pair it up again but nothingI came to the conclusion that the case is broken so now I have to buy another case.

At first I thought it was ""user"" error, but after speaking with Apple Advisor and trying to troubleshoot the product, they don't seem to work properly.

It was listed as having IOS 6 installed as it was originally, but came with the latest IOS 10.3.3 which the 32 bit processor will use.  I am happy with it, but unfamiliar with some features and can't find an Apple publication covering use of the iPad 4 with the IOS 10.3.3 system installed.

Tablets & eBook Readers,Great Apple iPad to Use!,"I purchased this iPad as a gift for my daughter. She absolutely loves it!It's easy to set up. She didn't need to get a contract through her internet provider. She runs the Wi-Fi off the hotspot from her iphone. Otherwise, the internet can also be used from other free Wi-Fi spots in various locations.She mainly uses it for social media such as Face Book, Instagram, Snap Chat, etc. and also to play games from her apps.The 9.7"" iPad is a great size, simple and easy to use. Has a built in camera along with video. You can even FaceTime off this iPad.To sum it up, it's really like using a ""super-sized"" Apple iPhone.I can't really compare it to other brands because we only use Apple products.Read full review...",5
Tablets & eBook Readers,Great iPad for money,"iPad 4 is an older iPad but still gets iOS 10. It runs well on 10 with great battery life. I have bought several of these for my kids and the love them. It makes a great starter tab without investing a ton of money.  Apple is all I by anymore, I have tried all the others windows ugh very outdated and android very slow after 3 months, blackberry well stone age applies there. Anyway this is a good iPad to start with or if you are on a budget. I have several newer iPad Air and pro that me and my wife use and I can say unless your gaming you will not notice a differance in proformance. With using all apple in the family makes for a very seamless communication experience and sharing of apps and documents, planning and even playing simple games together. Monopoly or other type table game play with everyone on their iPad is a great family time.Anyway this is a good iPad for anyone looking for a solid unit that will work every time. Also this seller I purchased from is a trusted seller. I have purchased several from them and all arrive quick and in good working order.Read full review...",5
Tablets & eBook Readers,Best tablet period! Made even better with a full keyboard folio.,"After trying 2 cheaper 10 inch Android tablets and returning all of them due to slow performance and bad apps, I finally bit the built and spent the extra for an Apple. After two weeks with this thing it's clear that this is the tablet to get.  It's simply unbelievable in the sense that it's so superior to other tablets I've used.  It's performance is absolutely at the bleeding edge of technology for mobile computing.  The user experience is so satisfying, much better than a Windows laptop or Android tablet.  You just really are going to be missing a special experience if you buy a ""different"" tablet.The screen is absolutely superb.  Text and web browsing is just so smooth and crisp here;  simply as good as it gets. It leaves nothing to be desired with the smooth scrolling and pinch zooming, it just makes you appreciate it more once you've used ""other"" tablets. It's apps selection is absolutely excellent, and the apps themselves are of incredible quality.  The build quality of the iPad 4 are just simply industry leading, while I highly recommend a full screen protector and case just to keep it nice and pretty.Using the iPad in your hands can get a little tiring, but this all goes away once you buy a nice folio case that can act as a stand. I purchased a full keyboard folio from Kesington, and the experience has went up ten foldGaming performance on this thing is very impressive, no lag in games period. Games like Nova 3 and Modern Combat are just brilliant on this display, and run super smooth.The only con I can say is the lack of mouse support, and the hefty asking price of the iPads. But once you use it for a while, you realize the price is really justified in comparison to the experience you get with the other tablets. Also the experience is dramatically increased with the additional purchase of a keyboard folio case/stand.  You simply can't go wrong buying an iPad 4th Generation with Retina Display. Definitely go for 32 or 64gb version though if you're planning on using a lot of the HD games.Read full review...",5

Tablets & eBook Readers,Five Stars for the 32GB iPad 4! Perfect gift for EVERYONE!,"For more than two years I used a 16GB iPad 2, wi-fi. It didn't have the Retina Display, but the quality of the display was better than any TV we'd ever had, so I had no intention of upgrading to the retina display version when it came out. I liked the fact that it had twice as much hard drive storage as my iPhone. I liked the fun features (games, music, etc.) but I was a lawyer and intended to turn my iPad into my virtual office. For the most part, I was successful: apps like CloudOn, Dropbox, Quickoffice, Splashtop and Dragon Dictate worked well with my mailbox, notes and the ""screenshot"" feature of my iPad 2 so I could create client folders, create and save documents, photos, etc., all of which were a few clicks away. I brought my iPad (and little else) to a mediation and achieved a six figure settlement that day!Everything I just said about the 16GB iPad 2 applies to the 32GB iPad 4 I bought new for $387 on eBay two months ago, but the 4 can do so much more! Twice the space, lightning speed, Retina Display and, to my great surprise and delight, a microphone in each app, instead of just the dictate app! To a non-typist like me, this feature alone was worth the price I paid, and the price was exceptional because the seller had to delete an inscription from the back of the iPad. I'm no stranger to scratches and dents on new purchases, so I jumped on this deal!In fact I'm the one usually doing the scratching and denting, so I gave my wife my scratched and dented (and banged up and bruised) iPad 2, still going strong despite numerous drops from 2-4 feet on wooden and terrazzo floors (WITHOUT the benefit of an Otterbox or other protective covering). As I knew she would, she LOVES her ""new"" iPad 2, reading and ""Facebooking"" on it every night!When I'm not using it as my paralegal or postal carrier, my iPad 4 is my personal window to the world, especially to our son, his wife and our only grandchild, who live 1000 miles away (thank you, Skype!); It is my hi-def TV, allowing me to watch almost any show of my choosing anytime I want; it is my stereo, with thousands of songs to choose from; it is my reading library, containing hundreds of ebooks, both classic and contemporary; and it is my ""playmate"", tirelessly waiting to play any game of my choosing.I know this review is lengthy, but I have saved the best for last: I am a paraplegic and spend all of my time in my wheelchair or my hospital bed. As such, I am dependent upon others for nearly everything. But my iPad allows ME to decide what I will do today with my time; where I will go; what I will watch or listen to or read or buy. In fact, I purchased a product I found online made specifically for the iPad. One end of the product securely fastens to the four corners of the iPad while the other end of the product securely fastens to a trapeze bar above my bed. When I'm in bed, the iPad is about one foot above my face, allowing me full use of my iPad, hands free, before I go to sleep, or if I should wake up in the middle of the night and am unable to go back to sleep. I keep headphones nearby so I can listen to music or to watch a show without waking anyone else. Before finding this product, I spent many waking hours with just my own thoughts to keep me company! If you have a loved one with circumstances similar to mine, consider giving him or her a 32GB iPad 4. One need not be computer savvy to appreciate, very quickly, how empowering the iPad 4 will be!Read full review...",5

Other sites I have seen this going for over $250 so the ""wholesale"" price is not a stretch. My unit came in a plain white box and a protective film on the screen.The charger and cable are both third party but as long as they do the job and last, that is okay. The product did arrive one day earlier than promised. I would recommend this unit if you don't need the latest and greatest.Read full review...",4

Tablets & eBook Readers,Ipad 4 Reveiw,This ipad 4 is so much better than the ipad 1 I've been using.

To upgrade memory is outlandish and is most likely the biggest revenue bump as they gouge the consumers on memory.

"Cases, Covers & Skins",iPhone bumper case.,"The case is very easy to fit, looks very neat and feels really nice. It only covers  the back of the phone, all corners and the sides. The case comes with a glass screen protector and this needs care fitting correctly. It can be removed if you get it wrong, but seems to lose some of it's adhesion unless you are really careful. Altogether, this is an excellent product and I would recommend it.Read full review...",4
"Cases, Covers & Skins",Does the job but not stylish,"This is a good product for the price but I have decided that it is not really practical in every day use. It spoils the look of the phone too much. It is possible to operate the phone through the plastic screen cover but it makes the screen look heavily glazed and frankly cheap looking. Not what you want when you've bought a top of the range phone.It's hardly surprising and I don't regret paying the miniscule price for trying it out, but I've bought a wallet type cover and thin screen protector and much prefer this.Read full review...",3
"Cases, Covers & Skins",Low cost but very functional phone cover.,The case is a good fit and easy to hold. The trouble with some phones is that they are like slippery fish. This helps give protection to your phone and helps it stay in good condition. The case is very easy to remove for when you want your phone to look good. Easy to put on while you are at work or out and about. It won't slip out of your pocket by accident. The functions all work properly like vol and power buttons. Camera is fully functional. What more can I say.  It works.Read full review...,4

"Cases, Covers & Skins",Lightweight and simple to fix on,"Exactly what I was looking for, a little protection for my phone and the cover not to take away or hide any good features on my phone.

"Cases, Covers & Skins",Nice case,"I wanted a case that didn‚Äôt need a screen protector, this does the job.  You can still write emails/text etc. with the cover on.

No other issue and happy with the product.Read full review...",4
"Cases, Covers & Skins",Not impressed!,"Hard to tell yet if this case will do any protection against falling, cause I haven't dropped my S9 yet, but when it arrived, I wanted to see if the material it was made, is any good so I scratched it with my nail a bit and you can still see it on the case. Cheap material. Not durable, not stylish, covers that beautiful back of the phone with that yellowish color it has, but maybe, just maybe it will provide some protection against falling. I will buy me a magnetic case to be sure... Max 2 stars!Read full review...",2

Cell Phones & Smartphones,iPhone XS .. last great iPhone,"The iPhone XS is a fantastic choice. It offers all the high end features that apple had taken so many years to refine.The iPhone 11 decided to come out but lack the innovative feature I came to enjoy from the 6S. 3D Touch!!I am absolutely disgusted apple killed this amazing feat of engineering.Get this phone and not the 11 or 11 pro unless you want those cameras; because this iPhone has more to offer than just that and can be picked up a little more price than the 11 or XR, and you get an OLED display and a telephoto camera. The stainless steel of the body of the phone feels really solid and it makes for a premium product. Get this phone if you have the itch to upgrade cause 2020 iPhones are gonna be the real time to upgradeRead full review...",5

The XR is smaller than iPhone 6-8 Plus‚Äôs, however the screens on the X‚Äôs extend to the rims of the devices, making the XR screen larger than iPhone 6-8 Plus‚Äôs.  To operate the touch screen, my fingers and thumbs must extend a greater distance. Also needed two hands for functions normally done one with iPhone 6‚Äôs & 7‚Äôs. It was also difficult to view the XR display in bright sunlight. There are settings to draw the reach of the screen closer; and settings to adjust sunlight, but the benefits don‚Äôt outweigh the costs to apply those settings. Then I bought the iPhone XS.  The biggest problem with the iPhone XS is the discomforting feeling for paying $1,000 for a phone.  Finally after 12-days, I returned the XS because of the uneasiness of the phone costing $1,000.  Then I got the X.  It‚Äôs size is perfect!  Couldn‚Äôt ask for a larger or smaller phone!  Miss the home button and don‚Äôt appreciate changes made without the use of the home button, like screen shots.  I take unintentional screen shots now because the side buttons on each side activate the screen shot, unlike before where it was the home screen and one side button.  Also inconvenienced that the battery percentage is no longer an option for the home screen.  It‚Äôs another step to view battery percentage now.  To require additional steps, or screen touches to perform specific tasks is not an improvement of the product.  It‚Äôs quite the opposite.  Apple doesn‚Äôt seem to think so since they launched the X a year and a half ago.Read full review...",3
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Like the new features of iPhone X,The battery will last for 1 to 2 days depending on how heavily do you use the phone. The face id works fantastic. I like it better than touch id. The phone is a little bit too heavy and large to hold. That's the only drawback I can think of at this moment.Read full review...,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Coming from an iPhone 7.,"I've been using my iPhone 7 for a little over two years prior to getting this X (even though it was used) - and I love it! Battery life, display, camera are all good. It's also the same form factor as the 7 I had, but the display is MUCH larger.The only downside I would probably give is that I do miss Touch ID because the phone didn't always have to be facing my face to unlock it.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Unremarkable upgrade from 6,7,8 iPhone but good","Unremarkable upgrade from IPhone 6plus. Though the phones form is quite a bit smaller the actual screen size is longer and a tad more narrow than 6plus. There is not much that I feel it can do over what I had to justify the price tag. Like most apple products it performs well and is easy to use, but I would be hard pressed if you already have a 6,7 or 8 to make an argument why you would want a 10. Read full review...",3
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great form factor but a sorry battery life,"The iPhone X is just what I wanted.  I like the small form factor, whose dimensions are nearly the same size as my iPhone 6s, but having a larger screen with OLED.  In addition, the  audio quality is also improved for both sending and receiving.The only fault that I found was that the battery life had been reduced to 80%.I ordered a new battery just today.Read full review...",3
Cell Phones & Smartphones,"Good shape, works well.",The iphone x arrived very quickly and has been used for a couple of weeks and works great. It looked brand new and we have no issues with it.,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Great phone but taxed too high,This is a great phone but nys and somehow eBay decided to tax it $50 despite the fact this item isn‚Äôt totally new and has already been taxed. Taxing Used eBay is like taxing a garage sale. It shouldn‚Äôt happen and in my opinion will be the end of ppl buying as much from the site. Read full review...,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Irritated,"I got this phone in April and took pretty good care of it, always got cases with port protectors and all that jazz but would you look at that it‚Äôs now not even fully trough October and the stupid charging port won‚Äôt change. I‚Äôve tried cleaning it out (carefully, with  the phone unplugged and powered off) and switching both the charging cable and USB adapter and nothing works. And OF COURSE isn‚Äôt it just great that it happened AFTER the time I‚Äôm able to return it. Extremely irritated, I need my phone for a lot of things and don‚Äôt want to waste time, and I heck of a lot of money on something that‚Äôs not even going to get me through the fricking year!Read full review...",2
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Nice phone,"Was using a xr for a while and was too big for my small hands. So changed for a X, couldn‚Äôt be more happierNothing is missing here.Nice grip, nice picture, battery is good all day, screen is bright and niceRead full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Excellent,"Better than new!!! I‚Äôve used the phone personally for 3 months. I‚Äôm including a Otter Box clear case that I used to keep it in perfect condition. Please see each photo as this thing is nearly flawless. Also I have original box, headphones (never used), and charging cable. I am upgrading to the IPhone XS (for dual sim capabilities otherwise I would of kept this phone for a long time!

Battery Percentage was 90% but now 2 weeks in its 89%, regardless, good quality.Read full review...",4
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Best item I own!,"This product is just what you'd expect from apple. Everything works as it should and it is quite fast with the 4 gigs of ram. As compared to the iphone X, which only has 3 gigs, you definitely can feel the snappiness of this one. The other added value of having CDMA and GSM compatibility, means you can use this phone anywhere around the world with any SIM card inside and it will work.Read full review...",5

Cell Phones & Smartphones,"IPhone 11 Pro
",  I‚Äôve only had it for a couple of weeks but I am sure that it is an excellent quality phone.  The battery does last all day and is not an issue during a heavy use day.  The OLED display is excellent.  I have not used all of the features of the camera yet but so far the pictures are of excellent quality. I would recommend this phone.  It will not let you down.,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,iphone 11 pro,Mint condition. Work as expected. No blemish or scratch.,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,good as expected,Arrived earlier than expected and promised. Looks great and works perfectly. Battery life seems to be fine. This is exactly what was advertised - couldn't ask for more.,5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,Awesome..Especially with new iOS update,"I didn't know what my life was missing until I finally switched from my Nexus 5, of two years, to the iPhone 6 Plus. Not only was I able to find it on eBay at an amazingly low price for 128GB, but the features on this phone are phenomenal.I still love my Android, but I'm loving the iPhone too. With my Nexus 5, I was hard on it, and I mean HARD. I'd throw it onto surfaces, drop it (sometimes down flights of stairs), etc. Luckily I had a Tech Armor ballistic glass screen and Spigen Slim armor case on it, so my Nexus didn't have one scratch or any functionality issues, so it is still in excellent condition. The battery was noticeably not holding as good of a charge as it used to, so I decided that it was time to make the switch. I've seen friends drop their iPhone from 2 feet onto carpet and the screen was destroyed, so I'm a bit paranoid about destroying this phone, but I plan on getting Tech Armor and Spigen again, as well as being more of a gentle soul.The built in features like Night Shift, which turns the blue light on your phone to amber light, which is actually way better for your eyes, at night is great. It also has Bed Time, which tells you when you should be sleeping every night to get the amount of desired sleep. Those are only two features on the phone that don't require external applications and work beautifully.The sound and camera quality are also better. I use Bose earphones and the sound is a little crisper and the iPhone allows the sound to go up way higher than on my Nexus.I've only had this phone for a few days now, so I'm still getting used to it/discovering new features every single day, but so far, so good.Read full review...",5
Cell Phones & Smartphones,iPhone 6 Plus 128 GB - a marvellous phone!,What a fantastic buy!I bought this a year ago and it's still going strong.

Cell Phones & Smartphones,Outstanding value!,"Works perfectly. It's weird looking at the memory usage and seeing all that space!It's an old phone, but cosmetically and functionally A-OK.

Apple Laptops,This is the fastest macbook all I could've hoped for,"This is the fastest macbook pro ever it handles my pro audio Apollo x and Antelope music interface perfectly  it  blast through my video software with fast renders and timeline video imports. I highly recommend this it's definitely worth the money IF YOUR A professional music producer and videographer and need the power. You can always add an external gpu if you need more power when you're doing high definition videos, but that another story capabilities are endless with the thunderbolt 3 bandwidt. The only con is you can't upgrade the RAM  and video card , so far so good for me. I hope this helpsRead full review...",5

Apple Laptops,The Most balanced MacBook Pro ever,"Pros:All updates, albeit not that prominent, on this macbook 16 are meaningful. For example,  the return of ""magic keyboard"", the pysical ""ESC"" button and fingerprint button indicate that Apple does take the feedbacks and comments from its customer seriously. And the update for the screen conveys a great sense of aesthetics.Cons:The improvement for speakers are not as good as expected.The video camera is still 720p, the longest last legacy device used on MacBook  (is it that hard to update to 1080p?)Read full review...",5

Apple Laptops,State-Of-The-Art Processors. Great New Graphics. HighSpeed I/O. GREAT ITEM!,"The new 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro brings a lot of new features to the table from the previous generation. Users now get a large battery that gives pretty amazing life, a better display, faster processor, FireWire, SD-card slot, and best of all a lower starting price. Getting more for less seems to be the trend during this slow economy, so is there any reason not to buy the new 13"" MacBook Pro?Build and DesignThe 13.3"" MacBook Pro is very sleek and classy, which is what we have come to expect from Apple. The design is sharp with the unibody chassis showing no panel lines or breaks except on the bottom for the huge panel that covers the internals. Apple gives us a very simple interface with little clutter (and ports) turning what is usually a mindless appliance into a work of art. To further simplify the design they switched to an internal battery for this model, instead of having a cover and release bar like in the previous revision.MSRP: $1,199PROS:-Excellent battery life-Great build quality-SD-card slot!CONS:-This notebook gets hot!-Good looks, poor ergonomics-Slow hard drive13-inch Apple MacBook Pro Specifications:-Mac OS X v10.5.7 (9J3032)-Intel Core 2 Duo P8400 2.26GHz (3MB L2 cache, 1066MHz -frontside bus)-2GB 1067MHz DDR3 SDRAM-160GB 5400rpm SATA hard disk drive-13.3"" glossy widescreen TFT LED backlit display (1280 x 800)-NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics (256MB of DDR3 shared memory)-8x slot-loading SuperDrive (DVD¬±R DL/DVD¬±RW/CD-RW)-iSight webcam-AirPort Extreme WiFi (IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n)-Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR (Enhanced Data Rate)-Mini DisplayPort, Ethernet, two USB 2.0 ports (480Mbps), -----FireWire 800, Audio out and microphone in, SD-Card reader-Dimensions : 0.95"" x 12.78"" x 8.94"" (H x W x D)-Weight: 4.51 pounds (A bit on the heavy side)-Integrated 58-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery-60W MagSafe power adapter with cable management systemRead full review...",4
Apple Laptops,Pleased,I was afraid to get the laptop at first but it works better than I expected. Their is only one dent on the corner and it‚Äôs not anything too drastic. The screen works fine too and it charges well. The only problem is I wasn‚Äôt expecting to have a Spanish keyboard but it‚Äôs not that different. Also my sound may stop working occasionally but it‚Äôs rare. It doesn‚Äôt take pictures either! Camera still works but no pictures. Luckily I only need mine for typing and work. Besides the keyboard and the sound everything else is great.Read full review...,4
Apple Laptops,Great Things come in small packages!!,I love this Mac! It has the perfect amount of hard drive space! I love it because it has enough space to be a great Mac as well as space to left over to run Windows which I use for when Mac won't run a Windows application. I did upgrade the RAM as I notice it lag just a little bit and now it runs very smooth.Came with lots of extra applications above the stock ones which was nice as well!Read full review...,5
Apple Laptops,Good value,"I received mine with a couple decent scratches on the lid (expected) and a faint dark spot in the middle of the screen that‚Äôs apparent on a light background but other that, I‚Äôm satisfied.

I plan to upgrade to an SSD, 8GB of RAM and a new battery and with that my total investment is still under $500....good luck finding a better laptop with similar performance at that price.Read full review...",5
Apple Laptops,MacBook Pro,"I ordered this laptop Feb 26, it was shipped Feb 27th and it was delivered a few hours ago today! It came in a discreet box and was well protected inside.

Only rated it 4/5 because I haven‚Äôt had it long enough to give it 5/5. But so far I‚Äôm very pleased with my purchase.Read full review...",4
Apple Laptops,I love my MacPro.,"My concerns at downsizing to a 13 inch lap top have been erased as I find the weight and size more convenient for every day use without any negatives in practical use.As a musician, I use my MacBook for live recording and for composition and find the battery life to be fine.The speed is amazing and Apple's Garage Band, I Movie and I DVD make production a joy.There's no doubt that the initial outlay of money is high, but the ease of use, and the elegance of the operating system make this a great value.Read full review...",5

Apple Laptops,i would purchase other items from this seller in a heartbeat,"great price, fast delivery, love computer and good purchasing experience. Computer does everything that my business requires and is much more affordable than newer mac laptops. Macs just rock, anyone purchasing computer for first time be it retired folks or younger students this is the computer for you. Easy to learn operation and super fun to play with. These computers are fast and user friendly. The storage space is huge if compared to file cabinets and should last for years. Personally, I have never had a problem with Mac breakdowns. I just purchased this model and it is the 5th mack i have bought over the last 5 years. One for each member of my family. We all love them.

Apple Laptops,Exceptional value for a 2011 MacBook Pro,Considering it is a late 2011 MacBook Pro it has very good specs. Decent amount of hard drive space for a mix of creative projects and customary work or school use. Enjoy having the versatility of going back and forth between both spectrums. A few minor dents but it is well worth it for the price. Would definitely consider my next purchase from this sourceRead full review...,5
Apple Laptops,Good Computer for the price.,"I have been using this computer for over a month now and i have not had any problems with it so far.

I have downloaded the latest apple OS mavericks as well as the latest versions of iTunes without any problems.

I previously tried to do some self troubleshoot but they told me that since I opened the Macbook that my warranty was VOIDED.

Tablets & eBook Readers,Good,"Better than Air of similar size, but has weaker battery, as I think, or maybe the device was used more than my previous tablet, that's why it doesn't hold so well. But it's fine for 1-2 days of medium-heavy usage, so, I'm not complaining much.Read full review...",5

Tablets & eBook Readers,Wonderful iPad,"I wanted better speed and better sound, the iPad Pro has that.  I wanted it to support iOS 11 and stay up with current game technology: no problem.

Been watching my wife use her tablet (iPad) for years but never felt the need for one.Recent experimentation with electronic music composition led me to Garage Band, and ... well, the iPad Pro is just an incredible tool for that.The integration into the rest of the apple ecosystem is also really easy to use.

She has an IPhone and everything synced right up when we set it up.  Text messages and phone calls can be answered on the IPad.  It works great for watching Netflix, surfing the internet, and even entering orders for her job.  So far, no complaints.Read full review...",5
Tablets & eBook Readers,Best Tablet Out There!,The iPad is hands down the best tablet out on the market. Its ecosystem of apps and media is unrivaled by any other tablets out there.

The pencil and keyboard are must have accessories and work great with iPad.Read full review...,5
Tablets & eBook Readers,Great Lot and Deal,"The item arrived unexpectedly fast, fantastic set and bundle. The iPad fits perfectly in the case, Apple Pencil connects and draws fabulously.

Tablets & eBook Readers,Great Value,"This is the original 9.7‚Äù iPad Pro . I got this to replace the 1st gen iPad Air. The difference is incredible. It is fast, very lite weight.

Tablets & eBook Readers,What a relief,"To be honest, I was initially nervous about the quality and condition of a ""new"" yet open box item, but everything so far has been just fine. This particular version is no longer sold by Apple. Slightly better processor than the revised 9.7 screen (non-pro) but not as new as the 10.5 Pro version ‚Äì yet priced between the two. Screen is bright and clear. Overall weight is much better than the original and version 2 iPads, both of which I previously owned. Dual speakers are a nice improvement. Battery life seems better too. Upon arrival, there was no charge to the battery and there were fingerprints on the screen, but neither of these aspects were detrimental. This item shipped with all the original pieces and showed no damage or wear. Finding a simple cover or case proved slightly challenging, if you're so inclined. A cover is not included.  Shipping was free but took a full week to arrive via FedEx. Tracking was accurate.Read full review...",5

Screen Protectors,Would not recommending purchasing,Applied to a completely clean screen and surface is full of bubbles. Same happened with both screens.   There is nothing in the bubbles like specs of dust creating them so I believe the surface of the protector is not flat so does not lay flush on the phone screen.

Screen Protectors,"Accurate Fit, Hardwearing and Good Value",I am a complete muppet with a mobile so end up 'drop kicking' it accidentally on a fairly regular basis.  Cant stand a bulky Otterbox in my pocket so have gone for these screen protectors and a flexy TPU case (Iphone8)..I bought 4 screens as I normally work through them pretty quick but am still on my first one!  They come with a wet and dry prep cloth for each screen supplied and are really simple to fit.  No trapped bubbles or dust. There is a tiny gap of about 2mm around the screen but the case prevents most other damage.  They are very accurately made for good fit to the home button and speaker.  Very good value.Read full review...,5

PC Laptops & Netbooks,Great cheap laptop,"This laptop is great for school and gaming alike. It can run most mainstream games at 50-60fps  but it does heat up a lot. Mostly where the cpu is. The fans are not super loud but they are noticeable when doing things that require high performance. The download speeds are pretty slow due too the 256gb ssd but it‚Äôs not molasses slow. The cpu is at a BASE of 2.5Ghz-ish not 3.7Ghz. To get 3.7Ghz you need to overclock the cpu and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend that for this laptop. Over all it‚Äôs good for people that want a laptop for school and mediocre gaming.
(EDIT/UPDATE)
Right out of the box I checked the laptops ram and I saw that it was 1gb less than what was advertised. (there was two 4gb ram sticks so there was no false advertising)  All I saw was that one of the ram sticks was slightly damaged and needed replacing. The internals of the laptop seemed normal. The Keys felt nice, and the touchpad was good. It also came with a charger. The battery isn't that great, it looses charge quickly. Overall it's very good for its price.Read full review",4
PC Laptops & Netbooks,Great home Laptop,"They've made the screen bezel on the S340 smaller than the S320, which a friend of mine owns, which makes the laptop smaller and sleeker than the previous model. Overall a nice looking laptop nice design and lines. The battery life is very good compared to my previous laptop. The screen colors are good as is the sound from the speakers. The Ryzen 5 processor is quite quick for my needs, which is just a home laptop and is strong enough for my 8 year old son to do his gaming without any hiccups in performance. Overall very happy with the laptop.",5
PC Laptops & Netbooks,Not what I needed,I think this laptop would be great to use if a 1.60 gHz processor fits your needs. I returned this product because I didn't realized this but thought I was getting a 3.40 gHz processor.,3

PC Laptops & Netbooks,"Errors, shutdowns and flickering",Using this for virtual schooling so constant error messages and shut downs are beyond frustrating. The screen flickers which is bad for your eyes - especially for a child. Not happy with the product and will need to spend more money fixing these problems. Battery life is barely three hours. I had read reviews and have a Lenovo for my business. I have not had any of these issues.,2
PC Laptops & Netbooks,"Nice  performing machine, unnecessarily thin and light","Nice performing machine, but I'd prefer a bit heavier and bulkiner to have more ports and an optical drive, and an easily user replaced battery.  Unfortunately that is next to impossible to find anymore.",4

PC Laptops & Netbooks,Great and fast laptop with an impressive memory at 12GB.,"Excellent and fast laptop. I was really thrilled to see how great this laptop was. When I first booted this up, it was so fast and turned on in under 15 secs. Wow! I was impressed with the built-in memory which sold me out when I saw its specs in the first place - 12GB at this price is just insane. Overall, I have no doubt this was my best purchase. I don't see any cons right now, hopefully it will continue. :) Light gaming is also great with its on-board graphics. Highly recommended.",5
PC Laptops & Netbooks,"Nice and Fast, But Full of Bloatware","Nice, fast PC, but....

Took almost half hour just to get to the Windows desktop.  Why? Because you have to have a Windows account, and log in.  You have to set up a PIN just to access the computer, whether you want it or not.  Lenovo also wants you to create an account, but I was able to skip that.

I don't want all that junk.  I don't want to have to enter a PIN every time I start the computer.  My Win10 Pro laptop - latest version - has the ability to turn this requirement off.  Why not the Home version?  My wife's Win10 Home doesn't require log in (older version of Win10).

It also automatically loads Skype when you boot up, and you have manually turn it off.  Constantly warning me to link up to the cloud for all my documents is very annoying as well.

The PC is great.  But after getting it out of ""S"" mode and into a regular version, it took a lot of work to make it a useful computer.  Thinking about getting a clean install and getting rid of the bloatware, as it will only get worse after use.Read full review",4
PC Laptops & Netbooks,"The best laptop you can get in this price range, hands down.","Flexible (hehe get it?) Light, versitile. It can even run GTA V at a steady 30 fps if you tweak the settings just right. It's not a gaming laptop, but I just point that out to demonstrate how powerful it is.",5
PC Laptops & Netbooks,Great buy,The only complaint I have is that the battery life is no where near 8 hours more like 4.5-5 other than that this is a great laptop at a great price it runs smoothly and quickly never lags behind handles multiple tabs and apps open with ease and the pen responsiveness is phenomenal all in all its a great buy especially for college students.,5

PC Laptops & Netbooks,A good deal can still be a bit disappointing ,"For the price and some tech know-how, this refurbished laptop came with most everything I need for office work.It runs fast, it's light, and the screen has minimal framing so to make the most of space. The downsides were unexpected (not described in the product information) and hence why I'm rating this laptop with 3-stars. With a 8/10 on the blemish scale, I didn't expect the screen to have a few light spots. Compared to the sensitivity of the other keys, the touchpad lacks a similar amount of pressure to apply. In other words, I have to click down further on the touchpad to select either the left or right mouse than I would for the keys.  This sounds petty, but the difference is enough to be disappointing, especially since I was looking forward to a wider Mac-like trackpad (compared to the more common duo-touchpad on thinkpads). Too, the mousepad didn't respond to common gestures (such as scrolling up or down with two fingers). By reinstalling the appropriate drivers, the mousepad regained appropriate functionality. Overall?  At under $400 (and with spare chargers for $10) this computer is a pretty good deal still. Read full review",3

PC Laptops & Netbooks,Perfect,Great little Laptop in fantastic condition exactly what I needed,5
PC Laptops & Netbooks,"Great Laptop, Fit and Finish could improve.","The T460s I bought is in great working order with just a few things to not be satisfied with. The screen and general condition of the laptop are excellent, however there are a few components that are not in the best working order. The obvious components that are not in the best condition are the two internal batteries. While one battery has a stated health of about 85%, the second battery has a stated health of around 50%. That means I will need a replacement pretty soon, but that is somewhat expected in buying a used laptop. One other hardware component that is not in the best shape are the speakers. Upon inspecting the the internals of the laptop I found the two down firing speakers to be damaged. Sound emitted from them is scratchy and the speakers distort if you raise the volume above 50%. This is not a big deal as headphones solve this issue pretty quickly. The LCD screen hinge has a weird kind of click when you close the lid, also not a huge problem but worth noting. The power adapter came with a power cable that doesn't seem to properly fit the brick. While power was supplied to the brick, removing and replacing the power cable was a bit difficult due to the power cable fit being pretty tight. Easy fix, just swapped the power cable for one that fit. The last detail of the laptop and the one I found a bit odd is that the laptop batteries were improperly seated in their internal cavities, causing two small bulges at the front and rear of the bottom cover. To fix this I just re-seated the batteries properly into their retaining clips, employing the two slots on each side of the battery. Other than these few issues the laptop is great.Read full review",4

Motherboards,GREAT board and a GREAT value. I will purchase from them again.,I purchased this motherboard for the extra ram slots and the spdif optical audio input on the board and it works awesome! I have an older machine that I assembled some years ago and finding parts for it is not so easy. The supplier sent it to me in decent packaging just wished there was a little more cushion around the board inside the box it came in because I've seen how easy it is for these boards to be damaged during shipping. There was no manual for it but I wasn't too disappointed with that since you can easily download the manual off of Asus website. I will order from this supplier again.Read full review...,5
Motherboards,Asus motherboards are reliable and worthy.,"This motherboard while ""old"" technology, was used to replace a used MB of the same model with a bent corner. That board remains a spare.

I've always used Asus products in my builds.Read full review...",5
Motherboards,Would be great if it actually lasted,"Well it was hard to find a good LGA1155 board in 2019 but this one seemed to be good value for money until it died after 4 months of near perfect performance.After investigating troubleshooting steps, Asus told me to contact Asus China and that it needed to be sent in for a repair.Read full review...",1

Tablets & eBook Readers,Asus Zenpad 7 inch 16GB,"I bought this one as a backup because I already have one, and it does exactly what I need it for. The screen doesn't cause me problems but I shut off their extra stuff. It has good color and clear picture. I watch free movies on apps all the time with it. I use it to buy stuff and social apps, news etc. The only thing I wish was better is the camera and volume. I have to use headphones to listen to stuff on YouTube and movies I watch. Plus music I've downloaded. Also the camera is touch and go, pictures hard to get focused and hard to get the right lighting sometimes. The videos I take them out better. But, for the price this tablet is very excellent. That is why I bought this extra one because I'm used to it. It has gorilla glass. Actually this is my 3rd. The 1st one I dropped and a chunk of the glass about an inch came out on the side but the screen didn't break! I have high speed Wi-Fi and it works well as long as I clean it up of junk files. I use CM lite for low memory phones with antivirus and battery life extender. It then speeds right back up. I had their memopad and the charging port broke. So, I bought this version. I was going to buy their new 8 inch from Best buy but after reading the reviews on it I decided to just buy another one of these and that was after deciding not to get the Samsung Best buy had in my price range. I don't have any problems with this with many apps on it. As long as I stop to clean it with CM lite. It is older and many times Google play will have "" this version is not compatible with your device "" but I download the app and it works fine. I highly recommend this tablet for watching movies, series on apps, YouTube, social apps and most games. Good tablet for the price. I just wish Asus would put an update of the system. For example the alarm. I go to change them and it says I need to update, it then leads me to do that and then Asus says the alarm they have isn't available to be updated. It don't matter as it works fine but I get tired of it doing it once a week on me. If they come out with a newer tablet that doesn't have so many bad reviews like their newest one I would buy it. The new one you can't put any apps on your memory card! That is so stupid! This one half of my memory hogging apps are on my memory card!Read full review...",5

PC Laptops & Netbooks,Worth it for the Price!!!,"I'll try to keep this concise, and tell the average buyer what I would have wanted to know before buying. First off, performance; its fantastic with no problems at all in any games I have played (Modern Warfare @ High @ ~100fps, Siege @ High @ <100fps, Control @ Medium @ ~65fps, etc.). Secondly, the laptop is EXTREMLY well built (if Macbook is 10/10, this is easily a 9). Lastly, while there have been many software problems, I haven't run into one without an immediate update solution! If you are willing to give up a small amount of screen real-estate and performance compared to larger laptops, you will gain huge amounts of battery life and portability from this laptop, WORTH A BUY!!!",5

Motherboards,Fantastic MB for mining!,"Fantastic MB for mining!  I run two of them with 12 GPUs each and have not had a single problem.  Due to the unusual multiple-ATX powersupply connections, there are some quirks you need to follow that are CLEARLY laid out in the user manual.  This is one of the better MB manuals that I've seen and it's obvious Asus took the time to ensure people would know how to use their product successfully.  IMO, people having issues w/this board are not following the instructions or are using cheap PSUs and USB3.0 cables/risers.  The board comes with the BIOS already in ""mining mode"" which worked great right out of the box.  I also disable all the things I'm not going to use like the HD Audio and Parallel Ports in the BIOS. Team this board with quality Power Supplies and other parts and you cannot go wrong.Read full review...",5
Motherboards,Unstable Hash Rate Until Properly Power Cycled,"Price is good and have the ability to install good amount of gpu's but the issue is its hashing rate instabilty.  When the motherboard restarted, you will have unstable hash rate that goes up and down until you powercycle the whole thing meaning you'll have to uplug the psu and drain all the power left on all its capacitors and then boot it up.  Once booted up, it will be stable until the next restart.  From what I heard, this was due to bios version.  Older bios version don't have this issue.Read full review...",2

When I received the motherboard it was packaged very well and had its static bag looking like new. Though when inspecting the board it had specs of dust between the chokes located at the VRM by the cpu socket so I‚Äôm assuming this board had a intel stock cooler with it and it was used for some time. Besides that everything checked out, tested the board found no issues and it‚Äôs just a basic board for a budget build since it has a H61 chipset. Although it was nice for Asus to include their AI suite with this board for easier configuration. Just know that most H61 chipset motherboards lack some modern features.Read full review...",5

Motherboards,Fantastic AM3 board for O.C.,"I personally choose this board over the Gigabite one at the time because it was capable of excepting more RAM.  It wasn't until i had bought it and started to research it that i learned what i had gotten myself into.  It comes from the ROG division of ASUS also known as the Republic of Gamers.  So if you own any of their equipment you become part of their republic.  At this point i'm now part of a republic of gamers and a cult of razer.  Which actually does make it a little bit more fun to own products like that.  The board itself is a work of art.  I am quite proud of the entire i system i built with it and it serves as an excellent platform for any high performance lower cost system.  ROG recently released a newer version known as the extreme which does add the advantage of built in bluetooth, more PCI-E X16's and the lucid hydra.  However at a cost of 100 dollars more and the AM3+ sockets and bulldozer AMD processors due to launch in a few more months it may not be worth it.  The Formula board was quite easy to simply put a bluetooth adapter into the USB slot and as far as performance is about the same with the extreme version.  This board has many little features built into it.  There are one touch O.C. buttons right on it.  a Bios reset feature where it will go to the last known stable configuration if it crashes during O.C.  It came with a free year of kaspersky antivirus.  The phenom II 1090t i put into it takes full advantage of the core unlocking feature as well as the O.C software.  It also features a USB cable to perform what is known as ROG connect.  Where you can connect a laptop to the USB and the other end to the ROG connect usb port and tweak settings for memory, CPU, bridge voltages right from your laptop.  The extreme version lets you do this through the built in bluetooth but i would imagine you would want to be near the desktop when tweaking it.  Over all i am quite pleased with this product i would highly recommend it to anyone considering a High end inexpensive build, since the bulldozer platform will be a bit pricey, If you have the extra 100 bucks and a mixed bag of Nvidia ATI/AMD graphics cards laying around then the extreme version would be the better buy for the lucid hydra chip only. The bluetooth feature is easily added to this board with a cheap USB adapter, it just can't be OC'd through your I/android/blackberry phone or laptop.Read full review...",5
Motherboards,Republic of Gamers is what Abit's Fatal1ty series could have been,"FANTASTIC. Upgraded from a failed Crosshair I ROG board for almost half the price. The technology on this board is astounding. The addition of USB 3.0 and SATA 3 is no joke. What used to take me 7 minutes to transfer data from a DVDR disc to the hardrive via USB 2.0 now takes less than a minute! The overclocking and options for tweaking on this board are insane. The black and red color scheme is also very well done and the layout for the most part is very well done.Only 1 of 2 negatives (if it could be considered one) is that it has one PCI slot...it would have been better to use that for an PCIe slot. It's the only part of this board that is not technologically advanced like the rest of the components. Even the IDE connector is gone. All SATA 3 6GB connectors here on out. The board is very forgiving with hardware and overclocking. The MEM OK button on the board automatically tunes any inconsistencies (unless it's physically failing) with memory compatibility. The board supports so many memory brands the support list on the webiste is now outdated.The second negative is the placement of the AM3 slot in relation to the memory slots. You cannot use a 120mm low profile CPU cooler in conjunction with full profile (ie tall heat spreaders) without sacrificing the red Dual channel A slots. You'll have to move the memory sticks into the B (black( slots. It's no problem if you are using low profile memory though as the low profile CPU coolers are a little taller than the low profile memory sticks.The board has a sticker on it saying X-FI Supreme FX audio chip. Not exactly, the sound is an VIA Azalia HD that support a software (only) soundblaster X-Fi option. The X-Fi software installation option is not available until the VIA audio driver is installed.Don't forget to update the BIOS via ASUSUpdate to version 3027. The early version were known to cause all kinds of instability issues. Plus the 3027 BIOS supports the new FX processors.I'm still learning what this board is capable of so this review is indeed incomplete.Below is what I run on the board. It's ideal for all situations.ASUS Crosshair IV Formula 890FXAMD Phenom II 965 x4 3.4ghz stockCorsair Vengeance 9-9-9-24 DDR3 12 GB low profile/full profileZalman CNPS7000V(AL)-I-PWM Ultra Quiet CPU Cooler (120mm)CorsairRead full review...",5

Will do more tweeking later  but all said great motherboard for the price.Read full review...,5
Motherboards,"Good looking, FAST, simple to Overclock! Asus' best offering ever!","This offering by Asus proves that ""excellence"" in computing is not a bygone phrase!This is my 2nd build with the exact same motherboard and the first one went so well I had to create another build just for fun. Using an AMD 1055t processor with my 1st build and OC'ing it to 3.67Ghz from the stock 2.8Ghz was simple and as easy as it gets!This board screams ""OverClocking"" like you've never seen before and gives you not only all the tools to do it easily but also the tools to monitor every aspect of your jump up into the world of totally fast computing.Why not go with an Intel i7 processor? Why when I can build a whole computer with an AMD processor for less than the cost of an Intel product that doesn't live up to it's potential anyway?This is my 5th Asus motherboard and I won't build with anything else! Quality and performance are second to none!Read full review...",5
Motherboards,a great performance board,the board performs above & beyond standard as well as what asus has made I have it paired with the Phenom II 980 cpu 125 watts I did have to try different rams to get the best performance it is 3way crossfired with XFX R7 260x video cards I put the EVGA 80+ gold 1050 watt power supply had to upgrade that bec it to a lot of power to run it it has the coolermaster v8 heatsink to cool the cpu the stock cooler left it run at 70 c I put the cooler master on it  went down to 32c OC clocked as for the ram its Gskill sniper 2000 MHz oc could have used onboard ports to connect the  extra USB 3.0 ports in the front of my chasisRead full review...,5

Motherboards,On my 4th crosshair now...,"Pros: so I have a phenom 2 x4 970 unoverclocked, 850 watt powersupply, XFX radeon 5870, 8 gigs corsair vengeance, 4 gigs g-skill trident ram to begin withCons: 1st mobo blew and took 1 stick of ram, the psu, and honestly it took alot of money over the past year and a half to keep this computer up and i honestly hate my computer becuase of it, all 4 of the boards i had to replace the psu and the moards and in one case the RAM, just recently i had to replace my keyboard and mouse due to a overload that fried them, after i replaced the faulty parts i realized the mouse and keyboard went with it.Other Thoughts: really good stuff on it, fast (untill the day it overloads and you end up paying for new stuff), just need to fix the problems with the frying if possible....Read full review...",3

Motherboards,Asus X58 Motherboard,I was looking for a budget friendly mid range platform to start.  This worked out great! Where I've been using it for a test bench system.

Motherboards,This makes a terrific gaming computer,I bought an I7 980X CPU for myself a short time ago and was impressed with the performance.I bought this package to build a computer for my grandson. New case with lots of blue lights. We have it running at just under 4.0ghz The cooler is great. It keep the CPU at least 10C cooler than my system. We changed to an overclock graphics card that runs 49 FPS. My grandson is very pleased with his new desktop system.I was also impressed with your innovative packaging. It did a good job of protecting everything.Read full review...,5
Motherboards,"""The Future is Not What it Used to Be!"" (Paul Valery)","The observation that within a few short years, any computer system is outdated--""an antique"" of sorts is tough to refute.  (I'm in my late 50s, and the technological evolution I've watched unfold between my high school days and the present has been relentless and truly breathtaking!)That said, pieces of kit like this Asus P6x58D MoBo lead me to conclude that in at least certain regards, the rate of techno-evolution has either slowed somewhat, or perhaps that this board--and the Intel X58-ICH10R chipset upon which it is based--were simply ahead of their time.  Anyway, the bottom line is that equipped with a later edition i7 processor--say the 950 or higher--any decent DDR3 RAM, video card, and an SSD, this exceptional board will STILL keep pace with many of today's higher-end systems, and that's pretty amazing given the aforesaid race to obsolescence that has traditionally prevailed.As far as negatives, while 6GB SATA III ports were novel at the time, Asus added them to this board using only a single PCIE lane and basing them on the Marvell 902x chip.  Besides various problems many experienced--including me--with this Marvell chip and its fiddly firmware integration, it's the original single-lane design that presents a bottleneck vis-a-vis newer boards' muti-lane design.  EASY REMEDY: I purchased a low-cost SATA III add-on card and installed it in one of the P6x58D's other two PCIE x16 slots.  Running my SSD from these multi-lane ports instead (and disabling the 2 Marvell ports in the board's excellent BIOS) unleashes the SSD's full potential.Other than that, my general gripe is with the unfriendly Intel 1366 slot design--a shortcoming certainly not specific to this board.  The gazillions of pins that comprise the slot are very easily damaged (don't ask me how I know!)  If a few of these are bent, bad stuff will start happening.  Break a few, and the entire board is toast--the slot itself is not replaceable by mere mortals.  Since the primary way to obtain one of these now discontinued circa 2010 motherboards is either used or otherwise refurbished, buyers are strongly advised to closely examine the CPU slot's condition, and ethical sellers should willingly include clear close-up images of the slot's pins.  Should anything look less than perfect here, I'd move-on by...Build a system in 2016 based on the extremely well-designed ""old"" Asus P6x58D-Premium motherboard (or on its nearly equivalent P6x58D-E cousin) and you will still hold your own against the competition--and you'll save yourself more than enough by so doing to trick out the board with newer add-ons that counter its minor limitations.Read full review...",5
Motherboards,Works fine,"This motherboard replaced an Asus P6T which suddenly failed (no boot, no post no nothing).  A pleasant upgrade over the P6T included a couple of USB 3 ports and  6Gb STAT.  The Asus express gate is something I have yet to explore, as is the overclocking potential.PaulRead full review...",5
